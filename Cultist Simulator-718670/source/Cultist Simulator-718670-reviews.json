It was a story driven game where you did explore the world, but none of the ship-captain-game tropes applied. to it. ;;The problem here is that it dispenses with the story which means there's no real reason to do the work to figure out the game.

Now, having beat it 30+ times, it's become a comfort game for me, and I've come back to it again and again after years of playing.

Cultist Simulator doesn't so much build a world as burn it into the blank slate of the card table, creating scorch marks and lightning trees that gesture at occult secrets. It really does feel like you're snatching revelations from your dreams and taking them back to the world and using them to turn people into zealous followers.;;That said, after hours and hours of unwinding and digging and burning... I found what was under all that work pretty empty. I won't get into the specific mechanics in case you still want to discover them, but the game is fundamentally about time management and keeping plates spinning, but I kept feeling like I didn't have enough control over those plates. The game expects you to grind and grind and build up resources gradually, but also expects you to start all over when an unlucky break makes you lose everything - a recipe in redundancy and repetition. And that's not really for me.",

You have cards, which represent resources, places, etc. You have verbs, which... you know... DO things. And you feed cards into verbs to get new cards. Simple, right?;;No. Not even close.;;For such a simple interface, there's a lot of exploration, experimentation, and fumbling around in the dark. It feels like trying to get the arcane details of a prayer to an elder god right. So... yeah, 100%% appropriate. It also has brilliant worldbuilding.",

For example, I hired a bomb-maker hireling and took out the younger elder. It has it's own text to convey what happened but doesn't go into detail of how. So in my mind the person I hired hit him with a car bomb outside a bar. Be warned it does not hold your hand and you will probably die a lot until you figure out how things work. That however is also part of the story because in your next play through it will reference your last character. Highly recommend.",

The writing is excellent, with a sense of foreboding and unease permeating every aspect of the game. Players will find themselves drawn into the game's world, and the sense of mystery and discovery is incredibly satisfying.;The game's art style is also noteworthy, with a distinctive hand-drawn aesthetic that perfectly complements the game's themes and tone. The sound design is also excellent, with an evocative and eerie soundtrack that adds to the game's overall atmosphere.;One potential drawback of Cultist Simulator is its steep learning curve. The game can be challenging to understand and master, with many complex mechanics and systems to navigate. However, for players willing to invest the time and effort to learn the game's intricacies, the rewards are well worth it.",

I can deal with the lack of hints on on how to advance further, part of the experimentation process I guess, I can deal with the many lore books, aspects and such with no explanation as to what to do with them. What I can't seem to get over is the tedious grind and micromanaging resources that may or may not disappear when you need them because reasons. Once again, its a good concept just way to grindy to recommend",

    "review": "Great atmosphere, horrible design.;;The game is about picking up cards to see what activities get highlighted as usable with the card you're holding. If you don't derive enjoyment from clicking and dragging to see what highlights on your screen, this game isn't for you.;;If you do, for some odd reason, enjoy such gameplay I still can't recommend this game. The mid/late-game experience is all about manually organizing a million different resources, losing track of one, and pulling your hair out when you accidentally commit to some other action because you thought the resources that got lost among your other cards expired and now that you found it its too late to change your selection.;;The fundamental problem with this game is that it should not have been a card game. It should've been a game that keeps track of your available health/passion/reason/funds in UI bars similar to how other games handle Health Points or Mana, keeps track of locations on some kind of map, and keeps track of your inventory in a fucking inventory menu. Nope, instead, you'll have all of these on one massive table, and you'll have to sort them manually yourself if you want any hope at playing through the mid-game. The majority of the difficulty actually comes from managing the cards on your table, not the game's actual challenges. Seriously, this game's design seems like some kind of cruel joke.;;Do not waste your money.",

    "review": "I absolutely adore this game, but it isn't for everyone. Cultist Sim plays like a card-based board game with a heavy emphasis on time management and putting out fires. The best part of this game is the lore that's drip fed to you in different item descriptions. You play a character that's taking their first steps into an (highly developed, internally consistent) occult underground, trying to scrape together whatever small pieces of knowledge you can find to piece by piece understand and harness the world you're diving into. Reading everything is mandatory to enjoying this game. If you don't like theorizing and trying to draw connections between pieces of lore, turn back now. The actual mechanics of the game can be deeply frustrating, in part because they are intentionally obfuscated. This frustration is made worse by the fact that a successful run in this game can be very long, and defeat can come unexpectedly and wipe away hours of work. This is a pretty major flaw, and I bounced off of this game three or four times before it stuck. If you're willing to stick it out though, there's an excellent experience waiting for you. If you enjoyed House of Leaves, Sunless Sea, Underhanded (a phone game), Fallen London, or the stories of H.P. Lovecraft, give this game a shot. There's another game coming out in a few months set in the same world that I'm very excited about, so if you end up enjoying Cultist Sim there's more on the way!",

There is a lot of flavour text in the game, but I feel the core gameplay completely strips that flavour away. I played this hoping I would get an engaging experience and deep narrative similar to Sunless Sea, but the narrative is so peripheral to the gameplay that I've now finished this multiple times and still don't really know what the game is saying.;;I have a nasty habit of trying to get all the achievements in games, but to get them all for this game is extremely repetitive.;;Maybe I'll come back to it later when it's all fresh, but for now I can't recommend this to anyone.",

    "review": "I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I love everything about it [i]except[/i] the game play. People commonly fall back to Dark Souls as a comparison for difficult games because above all else, Dark Souls is fair. It does not give a shit if you are the main character, you are not special, you will die like the rest. Cultist Simulator is not a fair game. It knows you're the main character and will punish you for it. The mechanics are drenched in mystique to the point where you will get challenges you could not possible have prepared for, and it will crush you all the way back to the start over and over again.There are a few things I want to specifically call out:The new game system. New games aren't really 'new', how you can start a run is based on how the last run ended. Where this matters most is after a 'Standard' victory you get a special start that is effectively new game+ with added mechanics, a special victory condition, and a little boost to start. Here's the thing though, as with everything else, the game explains none of it. It is not a fun mystery to solve or riddle to crack because the punishment is so heavy. Because you can ONLY start those runs immediately after beating a standard victory, if you lose the only way to give it another shot is to [b]beat the game again.[/b] One victory, one chance, hope you wanted to play another 20 hours to get back to the start.Magnets. The magnet system for actions pulls in appropriate cards for the slot. You have no control whatsoever over what they pick up. This isn't the worst thing, it means that you can't be totally invulnerable to investigators by misdirecting them over and over again. Where it hurts is when you have multiple actions on the board that will take the same items and if they get the wrong ones you lose. I want to specifically call out Fascination and Dread. These two cards are more or less the opposite to each other. Fascination generally represents losing yourself to the mania of the cult, where as Dread is depression and disillusion with the world. Fascination and dread both have timed actions associated with them that will consume cards which worsens if they get the same type and improves if they get the opposite, but again, you have no control over what magnet action takes the card. If you have both actions up at the same time, which is very common, you'll have to just hope that they go where you need because if they eat 3 cards it's a 60 second countdown until game over.For games with mods, I usually say you should play a few runs before you start using them. In the case of Cultist Simulator, I'd say you should play maybe a dozen or two runs before you start blatantly cheating. CTRL + ` (back tic) opens the console.",

    "review": "Cultist Simulator is a game that is endlessly fascinating. I can say I have never played anything quite like it. It took me nearly forty hours to attain my first standard victory but I was constantly engaged trying to solve its mysteries. It's really hard to get into what makes this game so engrossing without ruining its premise but I will at least let you know what it's not. With it having cards, different characters, and permanent death, it might be easy to think of this game as a roguelite but I assure you this is not that. I feel like it does the game a disservice to label it as such. Don't go in thinking of your various playthroughs as \"runs\" because it is simply not designed that way. The best analogy I can come up with to describe this game is that it's the language equivalent of a rubik's cube. The story is incredibly rich but it isn't told you in any conventional way. In fact, it's hard to even be certain that the information presented isn't just random esoteric scribblings but the more you read, the more you recognize. It's a game about timers, cards, and tiles; demanding you to keep track of a large amount of moving parts while being drip fed clues on how to proceed. My first playthrough ended unceremoniously as one would expect but my second ended because I lost sight on what I was really trying to achieve. What [i]are[/i] you trying to achieve? This is how the premise can confuse and torment you into thinking this could somehow not be a masterpiece. Look deeper, understand how it works, decipher everything you can. Even now, after only achieving a standard victory, I feel like there is more to discover and I can't wait to play again.",

    "review": "I do love this game, specifically for its evocative writing, and now that the team has made it so much less obtuse than it was at launch I think anyone who finds the aesthetic interesting can safely give it a shot and get something out of playing it. That said, it can be a frustrating trial and error experience especially when it comes to discovering and exploring the many vaults that the game uses as dungeons. For first timers, I would recommend keeping the vault page of the wiki up just for reference. Even with that help, this is a very time consuming idle game with many spinning plates that you'll need to keep in the air, and I can't see it being worth completing 100%% for anyone other than the most obsessed players. Completing a run is satisfying though, and it's a game that I am certain I will continue to return to periodically as I have over the past five years.",

Every card, no matter how mundane, is filled with Cioran-esque aphorisms and the broader design of the game makes you feel as if you're always one bad season away from losing and one good season away from victory. Before this game I couldn't enjoy singleplayer games, now I predominantly play and enjoy them. Thank you for unlocking that ability within me.",

    "review": "Cultist Simulator warrants a lot of the negative responses it gets, and is well worth dealing with all that. The game heavily, HEAVILY relies on your willingness to explore and experiment, which is fine, but like a lot of games that rely on combining items to solve puzzles, if you are not in rhythm with the games logic it's going to feel random. And, since it's a rogue-like, a lot of your runs will end in death and a restart, which can make it difficult to retain knowledge. Essentially, there are a lot of combinations you need to remember, and pairings of cards and actions you need to try, and it can be difficult to remember if you've explored a pairing, and what pairings did.;;That said, it's worth it. Most of the 'progress' you're going to make through the game is though your own understand of the game. The right thing to do is to examine everything. Read everything. Consider every combination that works. When you go to solve a problem, slot all of your cards and see what each one says. When something new happens, take note. When you need something, make sure you try every combination you have. All that helps immensely. Yes, there are easy ways to die, but there's also reliable ways to manage all of them.;;The next issue is that the game can take a long time if you're being careful and exploring everything. There's just a lot of possibilities, and if you're like me and want to focus on each thing, one at a time, to make sure you understand it, you're going to take a long time to get a playthrough. Granted, it's really cool. It took a long time to exhaust a particular story element, but I enjoyed it, and dedicated the time to complete it, and didn't feel disappointed when I did.;;Lastly, sometimes, you just don't want to learn the drop tables. This is my one major objection to the game. Some things you do alert you to the fact that there are no new possibilities. That's good. Some things don't. And some things are rare enough that you might do them 15 times and not realize there was a possible reward for them without googling it. It stinks, cause you just wouldn't know if you'd seen it all or not.;;Still, it's very well worth it. I love the tiny bits of lore. I love exploring new places and seeing what they have. I love amassing knowledge in a library of the esoteric, and probing further into the mythos. It's great, and you feel good when you pull it off. This post has been mostly warnings about the game, because that's easy to talk about. It's hard to explain how good it feels to get the next level of Knock, because until you are in the world, trying to glean the secrets of the Mansus, Knock means nothing to you. And I'm not going to spoil it.",

    "review": "I've played a lot of Cultist Sim now and I've enjoyed it greatly. This has been one of my favourites in the last few years and while probably not for everyone, I would recommend it to anyone to at least give it a try. My advice for any buyers of the game:;;- The game tells you to 'explore, take risks' and this is absolutely vital to enjoying the game. Slowly figuring out how to advance and not die gave me the warm and fuzzy feeling from puzzle solving. Don't just do the same things over and over trying to survive or the game will get frustrating.;- Don't be afraid to pause and consider your next move. Sometimes things can seem hopeless or stagnant while learning to play, but finding a creative solution to your predicament is very rewarding.;- Once you've settled in to things, READ. Alexis Kennedy is one of the best writers in gaming currently, and the lore is fascinating if you can get past the wordiness of the text. Conversely, if all you look for in games is fun mechanics then Cultist Sim will probably feel shallow. The occult ambience is what really makes this game great.;- While the wiki is very helpful and the lore is great, avoid it until you've learned pretty much everything you think you can. Figuring out all the different ways to reduce dread is much more rewarding than reading all of them in one go and not worrying about it ever again.;;With all that said, once you've figured everything out the game can get a little grindy and go on a bit too long while you try to complete it. At this point the lore is what makes continued play interesting. Recent updates have improved this somewhat.;;Overall this is a 9/10 from me and I'm hugely looking forward to The Book of Hours which will be releasing later this year. I've also just bought the TTRPG counterpart 'The Lady Afterwards' which looks great as well, and is a testament to my high view of the lore. Best of luck cultists!;",

    "review": "Oh man, Cultist Simulator? That game is trippy, especially when you're under the influence, if you know what I mean. As the Earl of Trash, I'm no stranger to indulging in a little recreational activity from time to time, and let me tell you, playing this game while in an altered state of mind takes it to a whole new level.;;The game is all about being a cultist and trying to uncover hidden knowledge, and let me tell you, when you're under the influence, it feels like you're really uncovering some secret truths about the universe. The visuals are so vivid and intense, and the soundtrack is like nothing I've ever heard before. It's like being transported to a different dimension altogether.;;Now, I will say that playing this game under the influence can be a bit disorienting at times. There are so many different elements to keep track of, and sometimes it can be hard to tell what's real and what's not. But that's all part of the fun, right? It's like being in a fever dream, trying to make sense of everything that's happening around you.;;And the best part? When you finally do figure something out, it feels like you've accomplished something truly meaningful. It's like you've unlocked some secret knowledge that nobody else knows. And that feeling is just incredible.;;So if you're feeling adventurous and want to try something new, I highly recommend playing Cultist Simulator while under the influence. Just be prepared for a wild ride, because this game is not for the faint of heart. But if you're up for the challenge, then let's get weird and dive headfirst into the world of cults and hidden knowledge. Let's see what we can uncover together, my friends.",

The style is not unlike that of dark souls and elden ring, giving you a vast and interesting world, provided you don't mind reading. The music and ua are excellent. The art-style makes everything easily readable.;Negatives - Once you win the game once everything becomes trivial. All standard ascensions are almost the same i terms of progression. The DLCs are interesting and kind of innovative, unfortunately the base game is a boring never ending grind and the DLCs are an even bigger one. It is also a shame that you don't get new game+ for them as I am very curious about what we would need. But given this is a studio of 2 people I can forgive that. New game+ is very refreshing as here it isn't just a mindless repeat. There are unique requirements for winning each one and figuring them out is challenging. Exile further fixes the grind and adds randomness that makes the game rather thrilling and fun to just play.;Overall a great game if you don't mind reading and grindy, boring gameplay;Can't wait for Book of Hours",

    "review": "I have spent so many hours on this game. A ridiculous amount. More than any other game in my library, in fact. And I still can't figure out what part of my brain it tickles or why, or how to recommend it to other people. I want more people to dive into and appreciate this universe, as it is so incredibly enthralling and mystifying that it deserves much more attention.;;I really wish I could recall how I started figuring things out and learning how to progress in the game. I definitely spent a lot of time on the Wiki. If you're an achievement whore, the multiple endings and legacies of this game are very satisfying to carry out, albeit with the help of said Wiki. And once I cleared a couple, I started opening the command console to better manipulate some things, and to figure out what they affect. Honestly I used the command console pretty liberally, after a certain point, to save scum a couple of the later diverging paths, but considering the sheer amount of content in this game and how many legitimate playthroughs I'd completed otherwise, I'm not that ashamed of it. If you have a love for collecting data, this game will probably hook you. ;;Wonderful and complex game, very hard to recommend. While I found it stupidly fun personally, another review summed it up quite well: \"I love this game. It is not fun.\" lol",

    "review": "This game tells you there will be no tutorials to enhance the challenge. I'm going to tell you that this game is a logical labyrinth within which a minotaur awaits to tell you to commit non-living. I'm not even joking. During my playtime, the most common way for my playthroughs to end is from despair building up too quickly and without any easy way to remove it, naturally leading to my character ending their lifetime subscription to existence.;;This game has a large luck component for beginners. Maybe when you get 100+ hours you'll figure out how to buy anti-depressants, but after that I bet you'll have the complete inverse problem. Your character will start to see stuff, their mind will open too much and then they'll go crazy. I saw hints of that problem when I got past 4 hours with one character, but that was quickly resolved when my character played a thrilling game of knife tic-tac-toe on their wrists.;;When you do find yourself in a stable pattern, you'll quickly find that you're performing the same actions again and again, with no end in sight. Any form of experimentation is horribly dangerous to progression and can end your playthrough. If anything, it becomes a temptation simulator. How long can you go WITHOUT doing anything that would harm your progress?;;I refuse to use any online wiki tools to learn the game, because I feel as though that's cheating. The game wants me to play it by its own rules; No tutorials or hints. Just play the game and learn through playing. That would be OK if it didn't feel like the game was always waiting around the corner ready to rob you of all your progress.;;The worst part is I feel like I'm missing something from my playthroughs, some critical information which would make the game infinitely easier. I might come back to this game again someday to see if I can find out what it is, but that's a worse feeling after the experience I had than it would have been for any other game. Most games I stop and do something else and come back thinking \"What about this?\", but with this game all I can think is \"What the heck am I supposed to do?\".;;With the midgame grind and the borderline sociopathic difficulty wall, I cannot recommend that anyone play this game. It was a neat idea, but I feel as though the execution was poor. I couldn't recommend this game to my friends, and I couldn't recommend this game to anyone else unless you have no commitments for the next month to learn this game.",

I do mean that it's difficult, but more than that I mean that it's grindy. This is certainly a roguelike rather than a rogue-lite, and as such, progression through each run happens as you get better at the game (particularly when you understand a new important detail), but you could easily lose the game within 5 minutes of starting a new run after just getting a \"true\" ending on the previous. There is also a fair amount of rng involved, not so much that it's a problem, but my best games have all been partially due to luck, to say the least.;;Final thing: I completely agree with the person who was talking about using the wiki (it's bad if you don't and bad if you do).",

I started playing it some years ago, dropped it, started again, then dropped it once more and then took the time to figure it out and got one of the many endings recently. There is perhaps two stages to this game: first when you are lost trying to understand it and is struck by a sense of wonder, mistery and discovery (especially if you read some esoteric literature before); then it comes a second level to the game, when you control the mechanics and fight your way to finish it. It can be an extremely frustrating experience at times, but rewarding as well. It is probably a faithful simulation of a cultist life, since you are dealing with your job, health, sanity and cult businesses at the same time. The soundtrack and sound effects are incredible. A hidden gem.",

    "review": "What kind of game is Cult Simulator? Uh, I don't know.;It's definitely a card game, but you could probably never play it with physical cards. It would be more complicated than things like Gloomhaven and Aeons End. It's kind of like that though.;It's definitely a management game. I felt like I was spinning plates, trying to keep insanity, despair and the authorities from ruining everything while researching, working to make money, dreaming about... stuff and organising for my cult to go on tomb raids.;It's kind of a rogue-like. I'm sure you could probably do some save manipulation but it's not built into the game, so you'd be messing around with save files. Essentially, if you die, go mad, fall into despair or the authorities catch you, it's game over and you start again. However, there's definitely parts of your game that carry on when you win (which I've only done once because I'm secretly pretty bad at games) so it feels like you're telling a story.;Speaking of which, it's extremely lore-rich. The devs knocked it out of the park with Lovecraftian flavour. This game tastes like Cthulhu.;This game doesn't hold your hand. At. All. I am not ashamed to admit that I had a few cultist sim wiki pages open because damn, it's complicated and not at all obvious what you're supposed to do, although there are hints and the game is very intuitive. I would recommend you don't simply follow a guide to victory but don't feel bad if you need to look up how upgrading lore cards work.;;So, yes, this is a weird game. But it's addictive once you get the hang of it. You want a follower who is strong in Moth and writing manuscripts for patrons will make you rich as heck. Those are my two tips.;Have fun pulling off your flesh and existing within the Manus.",

    "review": "I acknowledge that the game advertises its lack of a tutorial as \"part of the challenge\" right on the store page, but the deliberately obtuse directions and total lack of clear objectives or indicators of progress are far too hostile to the beginning player. These issues, compounded with several others, collectively fail to create any incentive to explore many gameplay options or engage with the lore, which, to my understanding, almost universally receives high praise. Nearly every facet of this game is hurt by this.;;The gameplay cycle can really only be described as tedium; the initial phase of resource pooling at the start of a run does vary a little depending on the legacy you choose, but afterwards, every run proceeds the same for hours. The inconsistent durations of the action timers, as well as the intrusion of random actions, necessitate frequent pausing which really kills any sense of flow and can be particularly distracting when working towards larger goals. While it seems like this game does have an incredible depth to the mechanics and the choices necessary to acquire cards for the major win conditions, I find myself only making incremental discoveries with each subsequent run despite active attempts to try new things and only having played a handful of hours, which to me is a really bad omen of the time investment to come.;;The current user interface is very clunky. New cards tend to generate on top of other cards in the spawn frame, cards that should be stackable aren't, and the auto-stack option occasionally doesn't work. The lack of an automatic (or even user-defined) sorting system is criminal for a game like this, and attempting to relate card disorganisation to some narrative sense of chaos is kind of obnoxious. I cannot personally attribute praise to the overall narrative or the little flavour texts associated with each action and card as the time-sensitive gameplay cycle discourages paying attention to them, and I haven't quite developed a Stockholm syndrome brand of curiosity to actively seek them out. The art is pretty though, and the original soundtrack is quite good too, although the short tracklist doesn't help the sense of monotony.;;I'll probably still give it another chance or two, but I really cannot recommend this. It is frustrating to learn, and boring to play after that.;;Addendum: I think my previous assumption of a deeper lategame stage was a bit generous. While fulfilling the various win conditions does require fairly specific resources, the methods of obtaining them remain just as monotonous as the midgame. [spoiler]Farming Secret Histories via the Ways is a repetitive process, the Frangiclave tool is simply broken, lategame Vault Obstacles are no more difficult to overcome[/spoiler], etc. Acquiring the final few cards for a specific ending boils down to repeating these actions over and over again, with the whole process being artificially drawn out by [spoiler]Hunters, Illnesses, and other random actions that no longer pose as threats.[/spoiler];;The gameplay remains consistently tedious from start to finish, and there isn't really a sense of accomplishment after successfully beating a run. The overall execution of the game's ideas is disappointing, and I cannot recommend.",

You won't get any warnings. You have a huge board to manage and repetitive tasks that you must partake in or not advance. You are going to just place the wrong card or repeat your last action (that you've repeated literally a 100 times) without thinking and screw yourself on a solution to something irreversible.;;If you love pain and being punished by the game cycle, as a rule -- play this. It's 95%% amazing but, the 5%% (tedium, repetitive with no give, perma-punishments for simple mistakes and tight windows) really pisses me off.",

The writing and worldbuilding are great, but everything about the game itself undercuts them: you have to keep zooming and scrolling around to read tiny text; most of the gameplay is just dragging cards from one location to another (no helpful shortcuts like \"repeat action\", almost no mechanical reason to pay attention to the story); you're either constantly mashing the pause button on double speed or sitting around bored on regular speed; the timer and the sheer repetitive grindiness encourages you to ignore the flavour text anyway. You can go from perfectly fine to game over in three minutes if you're not careful, and it's hard to stay careful when you're encouraged to just mindlessly continue the same actions. A really cool game could be made from this story, but this isn't it.",

Or are expeditions REALLY long? (edit: Maybe they are really that long?);;Just be careful what you click on before buying. Because instead of getting the bundle with all the DLC, I got the one with \"The Lady Afterwards\" (I thought \"The Lady Afterwards\" was like some sort of special edition that included all the DLC or something), which isn't even a video game, and I have no use for it.;;In my defense, \"The Lady Afterwards\" Steam page has minimum computer requirements and is marked as DLC, so it's not completely crazy that someone assumes it's a video game, instead of a separate pen and paper rule book.;;But because I played the main game for more than 2 hours (since I was enjoying it), Steam is refusing to do anything about the mistaken purchase (I was asking them to change the bundle, but I guess there is no possibility for that, and I'm well over the 2 hour window for refunds).;;EDIT: I had initially left a bad review, but I'm changing it. The game seems good and my issue is mostly with Steam. Yes I think how the bundle is presented is a little bit misleading (mostly because it being a pen and paper thing is a bit unexpected), but I feel like I should be able to tell Steam \"In my 20 years of being a Steam customer, I clicked the wrong thing once, can we change the bundle?\" and Steam would sort this out.",

Also we can't process Steam refunds ourselves, but if you drop us a line at support@ no promises but I'll see if it's possible to offer you a merch voucher or something?;;cheers,;;AK"

    "review": "[b]In a nutshell:[/b];;Cultist Simulator is a beautiful, frustrating mess and a game of contradictions. It's a single player tabletop card game with a lot of depth and complexity, yet full of frustrations.;A niche title that will cater to a very limited audience.;;There is almost no hand-holding to speak of. Patience, tenacity, multitasking, planing ahead, and keeping track are necessary skills; requirements even. High tolerance to failing and starting over is very desirable to have.;;[b]The positives:[/b];;A game of deep mechanics, captivating world-building, compelling theme and setting. The music fits the mood and sets the atmosphere well. There is lots of lore and story to discover and unravel.;;Going in blind is the preferred way to experience the game. The game is at its best in the early stages. It's captivating to learn the intricate, deep and complex mechanics. The process of experimenting and mastering the mechanics is joyful and the peak of the game.;;If you get enthralled by the game and its world, it's easy to lose track of the time. The hours can slip by without your notice.;;[b]The negatives:[/b];;After the honeymoon phase, many of the game's shortcomings and design flaws come to light.;;The mid and late game can especially be a slow, grindy and frustrating slog. Ironically, for all it's complexity and possibilities, you're presented with limited endgame options. Expect to often be in the mercy of the RNG gods.;;The timers left a particularly bad impression. It's reminiscent of bad mobile game mechanics and it has little respect for your time. After a while, I found it more enjoyable to advance the time through the console. It would have likely worked better if the game was turn based instead.;;There is a distinct lack of options in regards to managing and utilizing your followers. Extra tokens for interactions with cult members and expeditions should be present. As it stands, there are too many things competing with talk and explore tokens.",

    "review": "Quite a complicated game.  It's slow going, and at first it's quite difficult to make heads or tails of anything going on.  I didn't get very far on my first or second games.  Third game, I'm nearing mid game and approaching the ability to start end game, able to reliably enter Mansus from three doors, but still haven't promoted any followers though I have a ton.  Also have only done one expedition successfully.  Bought out all the books in the bookstore, wondering if the auction house will run out too...also wondering if it's possible to get all followers killed and run out of recruit-able uniques (besides hirelings).;;If you are capable of getting past a learning cliff, willing to give yourself some outs by reading wikis, forums, guides, and watching a video or two, then this game will be quite addictive.  If you're not willing to do any of that, you're probably going to give up on the game by the second play-through.",

The lack of clear instructions and stated relationships between gameplay mechanics results in a pointlessly obtuse game that does not reward the player with a result equivalent to the effort spent trying to decipher painfully specific combinations and events within the game. Due to the lack of a tutorial and any semblance of documentation on the part of the creators, be prepared to read through the fanmade wiki just to learn how to progress past the most basic of events. Then, prepare to spend more time on the wiki than in the game trying to figure out literally anything about how the game works. A very strong 'Do not recommend' from me.",

The mechanics can feel frustrating when too many things are triggered at once and experimenting is really tough, which makes learning new things about the game tricky without using a lot of your time. The colour coding on the cards is useful right up until there is too much overlap. ;;On the other other hand: The UI gets more complicated as you go which is thematically on point for having too many things happening at once, but visually difficult to keep track of if you're playing a game with the intention to enjoy yourself. Some events that trigger are difficult to see coming and have disastrous impacts on whatever progress you made this playthrough, again - thematically appropriate but irritating when trying to play organically. I ended up opening a wiki just to try and keep track of a few more things / make a bit more progress before needing to restart again.;;Ultimately I'm not sure I'll ever pick this up again because I don't know if I have the patience to play more games of patience. It feels like a game that I could enjoy on my tablet, but it's too unwieldy to play on my tablet, and I have more enticing things to play on my gaming machine.",

The concept of the game is fun, and it has a lot of potential, but as it is, it doesn't work for me. Also, it has bugs: it often gives a glow around cards that you could supposedly use, but then it doesn't allow them and goes to tell you 'these are the wrong ones to use'. Lovely.",

    "review": "As someone with ADHD, I am here to say that this game is an absolute nightmare for someone with ADHD to play but also that I unequivocally love it. There's an intriguing universe at work here, a setting that you can figure out through careful observation of the butterfly-effect ripples your actions cause... OR, you can charge blindly forth, doing whatever you want and learning nothing from the consequences of your actions because you can't remember which consequence is tied to which action! The latter play style actually got me farthest in the game because I didn't know enough to be cautious and took risks that I wasn't aware were risks... and got some unexpected payoffs. ;;The resource management aspect of the game is truly killer for people who aren't good at multi-tasking, but it also encourages you to take the initiative and forge ahead with a deadline looming over your head. In other words: the unknown  MIGHT kill you, but falling behind on rent? Will DEFINITELY kill you.;;I for one am fully willing to turn myself into a whole-ass other creature in order to avoid paying rent, which is actually what one plotline in this game is totally about!",

But as I'm playing it, I'm constantly just waiting for that \"reward\" after hours of immense grindyness of this game. Some greater game mechanic breakthrough. Just something that makes all my failed runs and literal waiting amount to something.;;But in the end, I feel like I'm just flipping sand timers to upgrade numbers on cards I don't understand what do. The game wants me to experiment, but some experiments will end your run (death) after hours of grinding, forcing you to restart and repeat your previous grindings with not much in the way of new variable content. Each run is so incredibly long and repetitive that it really dissuades you from wanting to try out stuff fearing that you will have to do all this waiting again.;;In the end, I'm fascinated by the premise of the game, but it never seems to deliver... anything? Except making me feel stupid.",

I had a hard time remembering (ADHD brain) what I did to get certain paths and items that the game became overwhelming for me. I have played 20+ playthroughs and I can only recall some combos. I really tried to love this game, especially since I got it as a gift, but I just ended up feeling stressed out after each game I played. ;;Some of the things I enjoyed from the game were the aesthetics and the the different routes you can take in the game (e.g.   different jobs, skills). I would only recommend this game if you are GREAT at management games and crafting puzzles, you may like this game.",

The most it does is that it sorta-kinda tells you what cards can be played in each event, except that there's some mysterious additional factor which, of course, the game doesn't explain so you may not actually be able to play cards where it says you can.",

    "review": "I’ve had this game for a while now, and I’m offering this review from the perspective of someone who played it, put it down for a while, and then came back to it. When I picked it up again, I quickly remembered why I had stopped playing it to begin with. The short version- if you like micromanaging, keeping an eye on the timer, don’t mind having to restart regularly, and have a lot of time and patience to wait for the results you want, you might enjoy this game. If not, I would seek entertainment elsewhere.;;Now for the long version. There are some things about this game that I truly do enjoy. The worldbuilding, lore and writing are all absolutely wonderful. Everything is written in a very elegant and imaginative way, and it drew me in very quickly to what might be going on in this created world. It also had a lot of surprises- the first time I entered the Mansus via dreams it was completely accidental and I was stunned by my new discovery. There are a lot of little secrets you can uncover throughout the game, and I did enjoy that part. In addition, although the learning curve is somewhat steep (which the game made clear up front), the basic mechanics of putting the right card with the right action to get results, was very easy to pick up.;;However, my enjoyment was eventually swept away with the boredom and frustration I felt as the game progressed. I expected some level of frustration, given the warning going into the game. However I didn’t expect it to be as much of a slog as it was. It can take ages to get the cards you want and need to progress, and then sometimes you have to take those cards and mix them with other things to get the other cards you need, but you have to collect things for THAT, and it can take ages… you get the idea. And the whole time you have events with timers going off that you HAVE to keep track of or you will lose the game. And sometimes, despite your best efforts, you can’t get the cards you need when you need them, and you quickly find yourself at a game over screen, so you have to start from scratch with another character. At one point, aside from the Time and Job timers, I had not one, but TWO Dread events, Fascination, Hunter, Lover, some other event I can’t remember now, and this was on top of an expedition I was dealing with. It was a lot- too much, especially since it’s completely random and there’s no limit to how many you can get at once.;;My final straw this time came when I had a timer countdown for Fascination- if you get three and can’t cancel it out with Dread or Fleeting memory, it’s Game Over. The only way to get Dread aside from some random events, is to Dream with Reason. However, I got everything BUT Dread when I did that, and of course eventually the timer ran out. At this point, I had collected almost every location you can travel to, all my Followers were at Disciple level, and I had a lot of lore that I’d been building up. And this was the third time this had happened, where despite my best efforts and keeping an eye out and doing everything I could to prevent it from happening, I got a game over. Maybe eventually I’ll forget about the frustration and anger this game inspired in me and will want to try again, but I doubt the third time picking this game up will be any different than the first two.;",

I died by getting pretty quickly overwhelmed my first two runs, which is likely the typical experience (since there's basically nothing that tells you how to do anything).  This would normally be fine, if the game was actually fun when you don't get overwhelmed, but it just kind of settles into monotony.  Over half an hour into my third run I ended up softlocking myself out of progressing, and didn't realize it for about 15 minutes after it happened, all the while just living out the boring life of a boring, sad person with basically no cult activity at all.",

But you can pause and unpause as you like. This feels unnecessary and clumsy. It could easily have been handled as a turn based game where some cards disappear if not used after X turns.;;Most \"cards\" only work in certain ways, but they aren't sorted on the play table in any meaningful way. Nor are they labeled in a way that makes their role easily identifiable. Maybe if there was a tutorial explaining anything. You can click on empty card slots within actions and cards that can be used will be highlighted. Though a few situations I filled all required boxes in an action but the game wouldn't let me start it and didn't offer an explanation.;;The story seems alright, just not good enough to plod through the gameplay.",

    "review": "This review is as spoiler free as possible.;;The idea behind Cultist Simulator is pretty interesting:;Play a complex card game without knowing the rules, learn from failure and start with a slightly different approach in the next round.  ;Quite frankly, that idea gets ruined by its execution which is just a time wasting exercise in frustration. My main gripe, aside from technical problems, are the timers that frequently ruin an attempt at experimenting with a rule you think you understand. For example: ;Cards sitting on a short 60 second timer, that get grabbed and deleted when another 60 second timer rolls the wrong event, so you have to start a whole chain of preparations again, some of those with random outcomes.;;On the other hand the game consistently fails to produce a proper \"fail state\". After loosing my first two attempts pretty quickly to mechanics i had no clue about, the next 12 hours where spend on one attempt at winning. I would have loved to start again after actually loosing, but managing the \"real\" fail states is surprisingly easy when you know the rules of them and all you are left with is the failed timer events that throw a wrench in your attempts at experimenting with the cult.;Additionally in my experience one particular \"verb\" is extremely overused in generating new cards and much of the playtime was spent waiting for said \"verb\" to be freed up again.;;Then there are the technical problems, like cards not being stackable suddenly, events that reset the view of the table and the general ease of misclicking cards or UI elements.;;The sounddesign is mostly functional with pretty good music that gets repeated to much and sometimes cuts off in the middle of the track.;;The game shines then in its writing, pretty much as expected from looking at the lead writers previous works. The atmosphere around creating your cult is great and pretty much the only thing that kept me going for this long.;;In the end I'm left with the frustration that I would very much like to continue playing, if it only would respect my time in return.",

I've put a lot of hours into this game and I STILL suck at it, but I've always enjoyed playing, even when I die (which is often, lol). Would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a different kind of management game, especially if you're a Lovecraft fan!",

I, the Seer of Mirrors do not like this mote of unattainable truth. I, the Seer of Mirrors think this mote of unattainable truth is a pile of smoke and mirrors that has zero substance and is doing everything it can to posture and make you think there's a laconic shred of secrecy delivered by the left hand of the Queen to be discovered but the laconic shred of secrecy delivered by the left hand of the Queen's answer is that HOWL SCREAM GNASH HORROR BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ SCREECH GLASS SILENCE SILENCE SILENCE!!!.;;This is a mote of unattainable truth whose deep-scribing is a bunch of truths unspeakable, unknowable, untasteable meant to sound as sun-cursed and blighted of the Reichdale Worm and brushwaldian as possible but it's misdirection - the mote of unattainable truth beneath is a mediocre idle mote of unattainable truth that you can't walk away from while leaving it running. It has no tribute to reasonability and rationality, such as they could possibly be - not because it wants you to divine the window through the trepannist's smile and that's more joyous in its frivolity, it has no tribute to reasonability and rationality, such as they could possibly be because any form of tribute to reasonability and rationality, such as they could possibly be would ruin this mote of unattainable truth. Because the closest thing there is to an examination of the nature of misbegotten joy here is in learning how a spreadsheet works and if I, the Seer of Mirrors thought that was an examination of the nature of misbegotten joy I, the Seer of Mirrors would be certified in microsoft excel instead of deep-scribing a forbidden grimoire of moth-hewn flesh on london-derry.;;This mote of unattainable truth's deep-scribing, I, the Seer of Mirrors tell you, is a completely bland and simple narrative that someone thesaurused into sounding clever but it has all the substance of a JJ Abrams script.;;Below, you can read the unedited version of this forbidden grimoire of moth-hewn flesh if you were wondering where it started, because unlike this mote of unattainable truth I, the Seer of Mirrors'll be honest with you and show you what went on behind the curtain.;;-;;I am writing this review in the exact manner and method I fervently believe the game itself to have been written in.;;This game is trash. I do not like this game. I think this game is a pile of smoke and mirrors that has zero substance and is doing everything it can to posture and make you think there's a mystery to be discovered but the mystery's answer is that there's nothing underneath.;;This is a game whose writing is a bunch of hand-waving nonsense meant to sound as mysterious and spooky and surreal as possible but it's misdirection - the game beneath is a mediocre idle game that you can't walk away from while leaving it running. It has no tutorial - not because it wants you to learn through playing and that's more rewarding, it has no tutorial because any form of tutorial would ruin this game. Because the closest thing there is to fun here is in learning how a spreadsheet works and if I thought that was fun I would be certified in microsoft excel instead of writing a review on Steam.;;This game's writing, I tell you, is a completely bland and simple narrative that someone thesaurused into sounding clever but it has all the substance of a JJ Abrams script.;;Below, you can read the unedited version of this review if you were wondering where it started, because unlike this game I'll be honest with you and show you what went on behind the curtain.",

    "review": "This game is great but a few issues leave it too frustrating an experience to put up with. Primarily, it doesn't respect my time. I don't want a 40 minute game to go down the tubes because of one random chance and I'd love to see a story mode so I can actually enjoy the content of the game. Finally the odd angle the entire thing is set at which makes it tricky to read things which in a game that relies almost universally on reading to convey it's story is a serious flaw. ;;I want to love it so much but those issues hold me back.;;ps I tried using mods and they completely broke the game to the degree I had to install it on another drive to get it working again",

It's a game that I would also recommend to pick up on your phone/tablet/switch, the drag and drop was way to much on my wrists on the steam deck touchpads and I had to switch to my laptop in the end.",

You learn about the world presented and its rules, and how to manipulate them to your own ends, bit by bit, usually by trial-and-error or even pure accident, At the start this is mostly a matter of figuring out how to keep your belly full while also scraping up enough spare change to buy books, but later on the \"roguelike\" nature of the game can become a painstaking drag as you risk death while trying to work out a difficult and convoluted ascension sequence. I enjoyed the world, the implied stories, and the \"tidy up an increasingly cluttered desktop\" aspects enough to keep playing, but only with the help of a bit of save-scumming (literally saving copies of the savegame file to reload as necessary) that cut down on, most likely, literally hours of repetitive work.",

As far as story and lore goes this is an incredibly compelling game. Most of the time I've spent in this game is trying to read every card and going for the different endings.;;When you first start it's pretty easy to get lost so don't feel bad about looking up a starter guide or something. Whatever gets you through the initial learning curve to the meat and potatoes of the game. That being the challenge of the MANY endings especially with the dlc.;;Again this game is not going to be for everyone. But if you even think it could be for you give it a shot. I've found it more than worth it.",

    "review": "The flavour, ambience and artistic presentation are excellent. It captures very well the sense of rationalist magic, where even the gods can be compelled to serve given enough knowledge and planning. There aren't many graphics that are individually impressive, although the chart of the Manus is quite good.;;The UI, with its skeuomorphic presentation of virtual cards, is quite clever, but breaks down in the later game when many cards are in play. One needs to spend time regularly tidying the playing space. If a vital card seems to have been snatched away for no reason, the game may have drawn it under something else, waiting for you to dig it out. Or it may actually have destroyed something you needed, but typically that only happens for things you can replace. The game proceeds in real time, but is pausable. I like to switch between fast worward and paused; I don't use \"niormal speed\" much.;;The game is very grindy. Expect 40+ hours to work out how to win, and then 10+ hours to drive it to a standard, major victory. The working-it-out time can be reduced by reading the player-compiled wiki, but this is a massive list of spoilers and using it degrades the core of the game which is the character's growing understanding of the lore and background. The lore and the ways of winning are supposed to be cryptic. Unfortunately, the UI mechanics are similarly cryptic and sometimes one needs the wiki to find out how to do something that would be obvious to the character. If you like learning by failing and retrying, then this game will be a treasure for you.;;There are multiple, major victories, so the game is highly replayable. Some of the endings are specific to character classes, and some classes are only playable after achieving certain endings. Some are only available when using paid-for DLC. However, there are interesting aspects of the game that are available for free, but only playable after winning a standard, major victory, so I recommend getting to that stage before reaching for the DLC.",

    "review": "I thought I'd enjoy the game but it's just not for me. I'm all for wasting time but its not like there's even any fun to it, the game just goes in circles on and on SLOWLY accumulating wealth and stats, and bogging you down with \"Seasonal\" stuff that you can't develop any real counter to unless you change the values of warmups and lifetimes of, in the game files themselves, to keep some sanity you'd lose playing this game.;;Everything takes forever to do, taking up valuable time and usually action tiles you NEED to counter something right this second. There's loads of attributes or stats on all the cards that give you some sense that there's some deeper meaning or lore to the game, and there is, but good luck ever getting there by the time your grandkids are born. God forbid you die, which is likely to happen given the consistent depression you go into, or blind insanity.;;I tried playing the dancer, I was actually interested in this weird evolution ordeal. Then the save got corrupted cuz of an update. Fantastic, I'm back to an Aspirant being a Glover and Glover bootlicker. I guess you're supposed to accumulate this lore after spending Funds at a book store, studying them and dreaming in The Wood for chances at getting cards that might do something if you're lucky, and this lore helps your \"Cult\" that will fail somehow? Notoriety stacks like crazy and if you dare do ANYTHING you'll generate it constantly, so you're bound to fail anyway.;;There's no... direction. There's no point. I'm trapped farming gold for Glover and Glover, not doing anything with my Cult because some Detective either constantly sticks nothing at me when I do nothing with zero evidence, or has a field day with existing Notoriety because I wanted to make a contact, running circles in The Woods expecting a different outcome, and collecting Lore that I'll lose because no shit. This taking HOURS to do, by the way. I get that there's no tutorial, I get this is a trial and error game, but when the trials take a good 4 hours of my time to get any significant progress (and accumulation of stats and lore doesn't feel like it) and the errors are attempting to do so in any capacity whatsoever, it just feels like a shallow game that acts like its super deep.;;Magnetism happening at the very start of a tile's spawn/cycle is a travesty. Whats that? You're down to your last coin and your Dream tile is almost done, and you need to spend money on sleeping because your character has 4 different despair cards and will kill themselves if they don't get a smidgen of happiness? Oops, Time card's done, consuming its previous already stored coin. It'll just steal that out of your hands thank you very much you're dead now. You could have gotten the Funds from your job, if you had that 20 seconds of depression covered from spending 10 seconds sleeping with your money. By the way, as a \"reaction\" to despair, it takes forever to do. ;;The game feels slow, the game feels obtuse and clunky. And it sure as shit doesn't feel fun. Go watch playthroughs, or go read up on the lore on a wiki, it'll save you the headache of playing this game. Why don't I look up a tutorial for this game? Well you see, having to watch a person spend 4 hours avoiding the frustrations of this game just to get a step further than you is even more exhausting than doing it manually.",

The writing is great, the art is fantastic and the lore is extensive, bountiful, and terrible. ;It is a juggling game of timers, it makes you pay attention and plan and makes smart moves, well, to ascend.;I guess it is a card/board game. If the board game has completely lost its mind and decided to haunt the neighbours. But in a good way?",

It often feels directionless and confusing, but it does it intentionally. The writing and atmosphere are top notch and will be appreciated by anyone even vaguely interested in cosmic horror.;;The gameplay itself is largely narrative driven, with any time pressure being alleviated by simply pausing. It feels like a visual novel met the real time strategy genre.;;Ultimately [i]Cultist Simulator[/i] is... weird.

Now the wood, and then the bones. Now the flutter of the moon, and then the dappling of the soul. He was blood, and so will we be.'）。以及有翼人偶的——“白骨屋上的阁楼有扇窗子。窗子旁边有个盒子。盒子里面有卷绷带。绷带里面有团乱发。乱发里面缠着只人偶，因为窗户从未打开过。”……这样一种极其微妙的混乱感，令人着迷。（入迷+1）;;回到游戏本身，一款非常适合强迫症的桌面整理模拟器。流程可长可短，取决于想苟多久。如果有耐心为了闪刃教会攒刃密传的话，那后期直接无敌，一刀一个警探杀穿防剿局，伦敦兄弟会了属于是。;;玩久了觉得流程有些重复，希望早出新dlc，顺便期待下日后的司辰之书。",

    "review": "I really wanted to like this game, it was hard to decide wether to give a thumbs up or down. In the end I have to choose based on the number of likes it has, just to balance it. ;In the beginning, the game is truly fascinating - the mystery, the writing, the cool unique gameplay, you are eager to find out what comes next and find yourself playing for hours, dying now and then. Well, once you figure out the card combinations and what you have to do, the game becomes extremely repetitive and frustrating. Once you place a card somewhere you shouldn't, you cannot cancel the timer and have it back. Once you fail (and there are tons of ways to fail), you cannot go back to a previous \"saved game\", you have to start from scratch, the entire process, all over again. I like the comparison with solitaire, except that here the game from start to finish is extremely long. One mistake, and all that work and progress goes down the drain, and you have to start all over again. Fun, right?;I didn't even start about the game interface and the \"snap boxes\" where the cards go in. To play this game well, you should organize your cards in a logical way, and that is part of the fun I guess, but that is impossible to keep up as the game just spits out new cards wherever it wants. At least half of the time you spend on pause just rearranging your cards, cause the game just spits them out all over the place. ;All in all, I would say its a very cool unique game that needs some tweaking. I 100%% agree with what someone here said, it would be considerably less annoying if you could set up \"auto\" functions for repetitive tasks - e.g. the \"work\" box, and define where which card type goes (e.g. I would've loved it if the game placed the new card in the same spot where I last left that type of card). Easy access to previous saves would also be a much needed feature.",

When you first start playing, you're not really sure what your goal is. That's by design! You must experiment, just like an occultist would, until it all starts to make sense. Then you can take a step forward into the light, or descend into sin, or become something altogether different. ;;My biggest suggestion: Don't look online for tips or tricks! Play the game as it's meant to be played. Learn for yourself. That will make the experience much more satisfying.",

    "review": "Eh. It'd pass if I were you. ;;It's whack-a-mole with a Chuthlu skin.;;The stories on the cards are interesting, but par for course in the genre.;;What you get and have to deal with feels pretty random. There's some key places (research/studying) that seem purposefully slow in a weird way, compared to other actions, especially given how it's what you usually want to be doing. Resources are time based, and it's not always clear which ones you're going to need for something, or exactly when, so it can be frustrating as you can't actually just plan and build up and do something. It feels like pinball. ;;Example, you don't use \"reason\" to smush together the influences, you use \"erudition\", which comes from studying reason. But, smushing together the influences is also done via studying, so if you didn't happen to plan to have erudition on hand (which decays). But maybe, sometimes, you don't need \"erudition\", you need \"Glimmering\" instead. Maybe the wiki would help?;;There's tags in the game that help you understand what things are, and are used for smushing items together, but they're not 100%% reliable in terms of \"This slot takes the foo tag\", because they only usually take the foo tag. Putting something in a spot that it's not supposed to go throws it back on the board and throws an big annoying error. ;;You can click a slot and it will highlight cards it accepts (based on tag), but it literally won't actually accept all the cards it highlights.;;When cards come back down, they come back down stacked, sometimes, sometimes they go to some other place on the board. ;;Cards are allowed to be placed on top of each other, or half on top of each other. ;;Because things decay (or become un-tapped) at different rates, items that are the same but have different remaining lifetimes can't be stacked. So, lots of detritus in the game. ;;I guess it's on-brand in a cosmic horror game to not be sure and time to be against you (especially if you don't just keep the wiki open in the alt tab and have the game paused a lot), but it's just not fun.",

It's lore and characters and writing are absolutely brimming with intelligence and wit down to every tooltip and tutorial message. It introduces you to a world that will suffocate you and refuse to let you go, and on top of that will respect your intelligence enough to let you explore it at your own pace. Cultist Simulator won't hold your hand or dumb anything down, It forces you to assume the role you are given, as a scholar, a historian, and a seeker, and will reward you when you play it well.;;And if you do decide to give it a try, go into it blind. Experiment, take risks, fail, and try again.;;“The Wood grows around the walls of the Mansus. As any student of the Histories knows, the Mansus has no walls.”",

    "review": "I can understand why people like this game. It has a great atmosphere at the start, with lots of exploration and \"what does this do?\" and stumbling onto lore and a real sense of progression inherent in the cycle of raising health/passion/reason. The writing of the descriptions are great, and the ethos behind the whole thing is fascinating.;;But none of that can overcome the game's single, most glaring flaw, and that is the sheer, incredible amounts of grind.;;Everything you do is on a timer. You put a card into an action platter, and then it counts down a timer until the results are in. Sometimes that timer results in needing to put another card into the platter or it fails out. You're not allowed to cancel anything - so other things might expire. If you haven't taken an action to get a card you need to succeed, you're SoL for that attempt, because usually the action needed for it is the same one you need to put it in.;;Actions take on the order of 30 seconds to 5 minutes to resolve, depending on which ones they are. The average is 60 seconds, one full minute. When everything is going, you're left staring at the counters counting down, waiting for the \"time passes\" timer to throw something at you.;;After the first few hours, once you get a feel for the game's rhythm and have read the various bits of description, the tension that the timers bring gives way to tedium. The novelty of the esoteric bits wears off. Going mad from revelations simply ends your game, rather than giving you more interesting things to do.;;Ultimately, the good points of this game are interesting when they are new, but as soon as the novelty wears off, it turns into \"spinning plates simulator.\" Maybe that's fun for some people ... but for me, it's not.",

About the only thing going for it is trying to work out exactly what the hell is going on and what you're supposed to do to actually have fun.  4/10.;",

    "review": "I have sunk DAYS into this game. I would say weeks, but I only spent 1.7 weeks total playing it. I have legitimately done all achievements, mastered all mysteries of the game and can pretty much flawlessly take anything from start to finish without an issue. It's a solid game with a lot of replayability.;;First of all... the atmosphere and art are great... simple, but subtle, really giving the vibe of the small danger you are at all times and the mysteries you approach. The minimalistic art and obtuse (but accurate) descriptions all serve the point of the game that it's supposed to be hard to approach. Every bit of progress feels like a celebration, especially when you break through into another phase of the game. Discovery is the experience it peddles and it can be a rush. Though I instead love the whole lore and book collecting angle for which I am thankful that the next game will be JUST THAT.;;Cultist Simulator is a game that you can take at your pace, from any angle, allowing plenty of options for victory, defeat and discovery. One might say \"there are no wrong moves, just the wrong time for them\". While in the beginning you will be walking around with no idea what you do, late game you will be casually throwing around mystical forces against things that man does not want to know exist. Your first run might fail horribly to one of the most basic issues. Your second run might be more long lasting. But eventually you will get that first victory and you will approach the ability to just do them one after the other... and start really seeing what the game has for you.;;Also, I do love the Exile DLC for really being a change from the usual style, offered a lot of world building and a lot of perspective. I do hope to see more into this world.",

    "review": "Been playing a *lot* of Cultist Simulator lately, it's a really great game.;I've been a huge fan of Alexis Kennedy's work for like a decade, since Fallen London and Sunless Sea. While I adored Sunless Skies despite his departure from Failbetter Games, him starting his own, new work has been a massive win. He's created this new setting in a markedly different way which is summed up in the title of his current series of books--*Against Worldbuilding*, which is deliberately provocative but if you've played his old works you can see what it's about.;The Fallen London story is immense and difficult to grasp, it's extremely intricate and detailed and spans several years of additions to a text-based browser game as well as some full-length PC games; it requires deep digging and exploration to find. It's great in its own right, and I don't think anything in the medium of video games really compares to the infamous quest \"Seeking Mr Eaten's Name.\";But whereas Fallen London and the Sunless games were written as long-form works of prose, and are interacted with through paragraphs and dialogue, Cultist Sim is a card game. For all its wonderfully creative cosmology and intrigue, it's all told in snippets, in flavor text, and the single-sentence descriptions of cards. The emphasis is on themes and recurring keywords; you grasp at the setting the same way your in-game character does--finding an old Greek or Latin text with a singular mention of \"The Wood\" or and odd-but-intentional reference to \"The Three-Valved Door\" in a 15th century French Drama.;It feels as rich and mysterious as the Fallen London games, but is imminently more readable and digestible. I can't call it strictly better--I don't think Cultist Sim could ever make me laugh or cry quite as much as the other games did. But the card game style of storytelling *really* tickles the internet paranormal researcher fancy.",

    "review": "The only good things about this game are its variety, story depth, and visuals. Gameplay is unbearable as you have to micromanage literally everything if you want to win.;;An unnecessarily long time sink because the time cycles are minutes long and the speed up function is minimal. Progression is hard capped as RNG is ridiculously bad, giving despair repeatedly despite any attempts at gaining contentment from drugs, resting, going to the club, or reviewing happy memories. The stupid amount of restlessness given rolls over to despair too. No real explanation as you smash together whatever will work for hours on end just to realize the specific rites you needed to progress won't proc and you're left with a damnable amalgamation covering your entire board. Smash your keyboard when you realize game-ending event nodes will spawn outside the visible game board and you were supposed to know scrolling was possible. Also, the game is permadeath, so you have to start all the way from the beginning, just to get to one of the ending routes. That's 20-40 hours spent EACH game, not to complete all the content of the game.;;If that weren't bad enough, new games can start with gamebreaking bugs that prevent essential event nodes, like speaking or cult establishment, and action cards, like passion or health. You can't even change your cult's principles, so you've completely wasted hours on a good run because of something you messed up half an hour in. If you come across an opportunity to bypass any of that mess, chances are it is content locked behind DLC. Ridiculous.",

Game systems will feel cryptic and frustrating, but if you treat all that as figuring out a puzzle, you will be fine. ;Later on the game gets a little grindy, but just going through one playthrough will give enough entertainment for the money.;;Nitpicky review:;;Permadeath doesn't really work with this game, as it's too long and there's not enough variety between each playthrough to justify it. First 3h? Fine. After that, nonsense. I've played worker->priest->police and the experience was 95%% the same across all three.;;There are many frustrations with card placement bugs and quality of life issues. You will be moving things around constantly just to maintain the board. Disappointing for a game with multiple DLC.;;But as I said, game is extremely unique and an experience on its own, has potential to form its own genre entirely.",

I've passed the gate at the Crossroads for good thrice, been to Nowhere (and came back), took up residence in the Wood, joined in the fray of the Corrivalry, and opened myself to St. Agnes. The only additional insight to this review I have to give is that you should only buy this game if you want to solve a puzzle, because this is hardly a game and more just a puzzle. It's a good puzzle though, so if you have more patience than the most attentive TikTok user (that is to say, any) give it a shot.",

    "review": "This game is a passion project concluded against all odds by a couple all on their own. It's fun, beautiful, haunting and mysterious in an eloquent way that only the brilliant mind behind it (and Sunless Seas) would be able conceive (and ultimately execute). The writing is nothing short of genius, and to those with an interest in lovecraftian horror and occultism, this game is sure to be a trasure trove. As to the gameplay itself, it strikes an unlikely balance between convoluted and intuitive, but once one gets to grips with it, it's easy to let time slip by (I've more than once spent whole nights playing this game, only to realize that I simply forgot to go to bed, and the birds were already singing outside). Kudos to Alexis and Lottie for this masterpiece.",

I approached this game as if it were in a vacuum, that is to say I did as much as I could to know as little as possible going into it beyond I was interested.  From there, I made my own notes as I progressed and did the best I could to 'wrestle' the game into submission (as even the game says itself).  There is a lot going on in this game and it can be initially a bit overwhelming.  Organization is key, and finding what works for you helps as you track everything going on.;;The lore and the story of the game I cannot, and would never attempt to, claim to be an SME on the subject.  With that said, what I did experience inspired the imagination.  The process of discovery really made the whole process feel more meaningful.  I feel in a fairly large part that because I didn't push for other endings, or explore deeper, that I've done myself a bit of a disservice and there remains much more to uncover.  That said, I absolutely recommend the game - all I'll say is go in with the understanding that the game mechanics are a kind of language you'll need to learn to make it through.",

    "review": "Look, I want to like this game.;;It's interesting enough. It's got a pretty nice core mechanic of fumbling about with different cards that makes you feel like you're juggling different plates and fiddling with things you definitely cannot comprehend. The opening half-hour of things appearing and disappearing and you still don't really understand how it all works is very much a cool experience.;;And then the grind kicks in. Once you master the basic mechanics and sequences, there really isn't anything that keeps you interested in them. The pause button means there isn't really a sense of tension considering you can frame-perfect all the timing windows whenever you want, and the random number generator of it all gets old really fast. Even otherwise \"reliable\" ways of generating needed resources to progress are not just frustratingly hidden but also annoyingly random in their results. Does studying this book give you the red card you need or the orange card that does nothing?  Well, could be either! Weird and interesting the first time, but it gets old real quick.;;Not to mention the lack of a tutorial *will* drive you to a guide. If only because of how weird and non-intuitive getting some of the middle- or end-game challenges are. There's a tooltip button that shows you what cards can go where, but that's only helpful to a point. If you want to beat the game, you need a guide. You can do it without one, but it is maddeningly frustrating in the worst way.;;If this is your jam, and you care enough about memorising all the RNG tables and details to put together a real run, and that sounds like a fun time for you, go for your life.

I fired up the vanilla game, with zero clue what was going on. I'm 8 hours in now, and have only attained a tiny clue so far. However, the game, presented as a table top game, manages to be both stressful and oddly satisfying to play. It's got a pretty steep learning curve, but with a little persistence, and allowance for several failures, you'll come to appreciate the gameplay, intricate story and low key menace that is the feel to the game. ;;I soldier on, and will eventually conquer this game. My only advice to you, gentle reader, is fall in love with your space bar. Pausing the game is an essential tool. I had no idea at first, but I learned. Quickly.",

Tries to be clever by having you figure things out as you go along (they are not kidding about having No Tutorial) but once you crack the code you realize it's ultimately grindier than an idle game with \"Ascensions\". Just repeating the same actions with some minor elements of RNG until you build up enough resources to take the next big step and then...repeat, but longer this time. Points for dev responsiveness and how they even give tips on how to mod the game to make it easier but ultimately feels like you're stuck in mud and at the end of 2 hours and multiple deaths I was no closer to having fun than before. Disappointing because it looks like there's a lot the game has to offer but it's not worth the slog.",

    "review": "This is a first for me, in several ways. First time playing a timer-based rogue-like card game with no absolutely no clue about what the game wants for me to survive and win. I found the contents of the game interesting and stimulating, while at the same time excessively frustrating. Try and die. Try and die. Try and die. I began to get the rhythm in one play through only to be killed by RNG. And the advice the game gives after each run seemed to be of very little actual help in successive plays due, I think, to the randomness of both starter options and actual play through events. I then began to see the game for the grind it was and deeply resented the timers and lack of guidance. The game does show glimmers of genius in the ways it simulates real life elements and causes you similarly to share the feelings of your character about anxiety and mundane routine and life needs. For that, it deserves kudos.;;When I was 20, I probably would've loved this game. Now that I'm past 50, not so much. When you have less time left in the world, seems like for me anyway, you tend to have less patience for needlessly mysterious timesucks. And this is also a first for me--first time wishing I could give a neutral review for a game. You might love it. I might revisit it (haven't yet uninstalled). Today, I can't recommend it because of the needlessly steep learning curve combined with the need to sink so much time into learning what could have been made simple with a few insights from the enigma-loving dev(s). The next time I want to torture myself with the elements of life I've already experienced (and endured) combined with the mysterious doings of dark cosmic forces, I'll borrow some books from the library that I don't have time to read and overspend my budget for the month. If there's time left after that, maybe I'll play this game for extra self-loathing misery.",

    "review": "I felt this game was an endless pointless loop, in which you can easily get stuck without being able to progress forward. ;;You constantly fall into endless loop grinds were you either have to die and restart or grind incredibly slowly with little change. I just wish the game would pull the plug. as you don't know if you are playing it correctly.;;There isn't many instructions on how to play or tactics, for a new player. Its not very clear for  a new player to understand what objectives you need to aim for. Or what cards turn into what. I felt every single time I was mashing buttons hoping something would highlight, even once I slowed down and read every prompt, I still didn't really have a goal as a player.;It just seems to be one of those games I played it for 5 hours getting better slightly each time, surviving longer. But with little progression. I felt like I only progressed 10%% of what the game actually is. It just became such a grind I just couldn't take it anymore. I guess I just really sucked at this game. ;;It reminds me of minecraft, where you have to rely on external wiki's to understand what is going on but even so after watching a few videos it just felt like a grind. and really took the fun out of what you first experience with this game. After 5 hours I really felt I wasn't achieving anything. Its too much random attributes without a clear goal. If you really like learning obscure rules, this is the game for you. However if this is something you can throw some time into it and eventually finish. its to confusing, you spend more time trying to understand how to balance everything then aiming for the objective. too much going on at once, will overwhelm any causal player. ;;Game also crashed about 4-5 times in the four-ish hours for no reason. Unity just froze up and bottomed out, even more annoying when you are on a good run. ;;I got to the point, that my conclusion was this was lazy game design. As reading the store front, they promote how the game doesn't need a tutorial. So stupid, you just alienated an entire user base. after the 5 hours I really felt like I wasted my time. A tutorial should exist, does not have to reveal everything, but just enough to get you started. Or to lend a helping hand when you are visibly stuck ;;I don't recommend, unless you spend some time watching other people teach you the game online.  Otherwise its a grind and soon as you realise there is no way of telling you, you are doing something right. you have no clue if you are progressing correctly.",

You lose if you run empty, on core resources or accumulate too many \"bad\" cards. Survival element very rarely adds something to a game. In this case it fits thematically, but it's still just game time padding. Look past that padding and you'll see how shallow the core (crafting) side is.",

    "review": "Neat idea and fairly unique in terms of execution, but has a lot of problems. The game is a mashup of a lot of elements but it boils down to a semi-worker placement card game revolving around a lot of trial-and-error and hoping to get lucky with the correct combination of things appearing. This idea works in \"Stacklands\" because it is quicker, more focused, and not as punishing.;;However, here it is very painful as the \"try different combinations to get things to work\" takes time, effort, energy, and more all while other things are ticking on in the background. It is very easy to spiral out of control with not having money or enough resources to solve problems that pop up. Not a deal breaker itself, but there are 2 key issues that result in it being a mess.;;First, there are no save slots -- it is a rogue-like where you will be spending hours building up and \"rolling the dice\" on finding things that can all end abruptly if you mess up or get unlucky. With multiple save slots you could actually experiment and figure stuff out without dooming a multiple hour game from a single tiny mistake.;;And second -- the game often boils down to rolling for specific items over and over hoping to get the correct type of magic to progress. There are 9-ish paths of magic and getting pieces of them is largely random. You meander around collecting fragments of lore to complete a mission and only 1/9th of them are applicable (yes some build / help get others but how would you know without more trial-and-error?). That means you're juggling dozens of things just to hope you roll the dice on finding the right combination you're looking for.;;Even using a Wiki to look up the stuff is difficult because there is just so much thrown together in convoluted ways. This game might have been a borderline recommend if they simple had save states and the ability to undo things... but make some mistakes and you're back to 3+ hours of grinding to get back to where you were all because you did the wrong thing without knowing any better. Ugh.;;Cool idea, neat theme, and fun mechanisms... but the whole execution is a slog. 4/10. Just pick up \"Stacklands\" instead.",

    "review": "Cultist Simulator is a game filled with unrealized potential. ;;A typical playthrough takes 20+ hours, but only ~5 hours of your first game will be exploring and figuring out how stuff works. Once you've done that, the game degenerates just route 'going through the motions' as you farm up enough resources to achieve your goals.;;One example is exploration. If you want to explore 1 location in the Evening Isles, you need to farm up 16 Chronicles, and each Chronicle has a 33%% chance of dropping from an activity that takes 1 minute to complete... so on average, you'll be doing that exact same activity 48 times per exploration, and you might need to do that exploration 5 times to collect an item you need to win the game, so now you're doing that activity 240 times. That's 3 hours of nothing but grinding chronicles. Absurd. ;;Secondly, the game supposedly has a pretty big focus on lore and mystique, and it does... but only on the surface. You soon learn that the game's lore has very little to do with the actual mechanics, and it doesn't matter if you know who The Colonel is or what The Door in the Eye and the Forge of Days are, or why you would want to invoke any of them. The only thing that matters is that this obstacle needs 10 'lantern' to defeat it, and 'lantern' is basically just 'yellow mana' in the vein of MTG. You never need to (and, in fact, cannot) ever use any of the lore you uncover for solving puzzles or making deductions. It's all irrelevant narrative fluff.;;Finally, Cultist Simulator doesn't actually simulate running a cult. Every cultist you can recruit is identical except for their 'mana' type. They have no personality, desires, or weaknesses. Recruiting them is as simple as saying \"join my cult, we have a shiny object\" and them going \"sounds legit, okay!\" at which point they immediately become your willing slave, following any order you give them up to and including killing themselves. It would be a lot more compelling if you actually had to persuade, seduce, or brainwash them into compliance instead of just showing them a cool object you found.",

The game sterilizes any intrigue or curiosity you could have about what's going on by making you wait obscene amounts of time just to get another timer and wait some more. ;;If that sounds like fun to you, I won't stop you from wasting your money, but I'd easily recommend other games instead like [b]Loop Hero, Ring of Pain, Hand of Fate 2,[/b] or [b]Inscryption[/b]. Please, look at any of those games over this one. They're definitely more fun and engaging than this shit.",

    "review": "长文警告。;本游戏的巨大信息量和lore深度已经被讨论的很多了，AK甚至还在通过ARG持续更新lore深度（有兴趣的玩家请搜索「虫鸟解密」或直接从[url=https://weatherfactory.biz/enigma]解密[/url]入口进入）。因此这篇评论试图聊点别的——游戏形式。;;1. 本游戏首先是一个「桌游」。;虽说密教模拟器主打带有「资源管理」的「互动叙事」，但游戏自身完全没有隐瞒「卡牌桌游」这点：玩家直接是在一张桌子上进行游戏，游戏中的一切互动要素都以卡牌的形式出现。;游戏的核心gameplay就是在桌面上摆弄卡牌；随机事件由抽卡定夺；每张牌都有对应的面值和所属suit（游戏中称为「性状」）；需要打出相应的牌才能获得更高级的牌（如下副本就是这样一个过程）；收集到足够面值的特定suit卡牌才能通关（比如三个欲望飞升结局都要求凑足面值共计36的对应性相）。;对于熟悉桌游的玩家来说，密教模拟器完全就是一个有较强组合收集（Set Collection）要素的桌面卡牌构筑（Tableau Building）游戏。;游戏跟现实桌游最大的不同也不过是把「出牌-得牌」的过程用「动词方块」（也就是可以放入复数卡牌、外有倒计时的那些正方界面；AK将其称为\"verb\"或\"verb token\"）取代。;此外，本游戏还有一个特点是规则繁琐但严谨，到了仿佛需要规则书的地步（但没有任何规则书），比如卡牌必须严格按顺序放置在动词方块里才能被激活——因为搞错了教团卡和清客卡的放置顺序，我花了半小时才搞清楚如何创教。这种严谨规则又是可玩性的一部分，玩家不必重复学习，熟悉机制以后就变成second nature，但熟悉机制的过程非常艰难。某种意义上这点也很桌游。;;2. 本「桌游」意外的「官僚」。;现实中桌游玩家群体一直不大，原因之一即是桌游需要的bookkeeping太多（当然根本原因是价格和不易携带，但这是另一个问题了），而电子游戏赢在可以把大多数bookkeeping交给程序。;密教模拟器几乎是反其道而行之，在一个电子游戏里全面还原了在一张大桌子上管理一万张卡片的感受。;总的gameplay上来说，游戏越深入，探索越远，要管理的卡牌（人和事）越多。游戏甚至把卡牌数量推进到了一个现实桌游都不会有的极端——现实中哪怕打完一局[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128780/pax-porfiriana]Pax Porfiriana[/url]桌上也不会有那么多牌，因为设计师会尽量避免繁琐的bookkeeping。;电子游戏界有一类「官僚类」游戏，希望通过非常thematic的资源管理来体现某种官僚工作（通常是集权官僚）的繁琐，代表有Papers Please和Beholder。密教模拟器虽然theme完全不同——当邪教头领和当官多少还是有区别的——但其对「互动叙事」的「桌游化」依然抵达了「官僚化」。没有什么比在一张大桌子上管理一万张卡片更官僚的活动；一张卡片可以说就是一份文件。玩家担任一名「管理者」，自然也会需要管理各种繁杂的事务。;密教模拟器在这一点上意外地跟一个著名桌游设计师，[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/6/martin-wallace]Martin Wallace[/url]，的作品同步了。;Wallace设计过所谓的「牌组构筑兵棋」（Deck Building Wargames）三部曲，以[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/79828/few-acres-snow]A Few Acres of Snow[/url]为代表：三代游戏内的一切要素，从军队、地点到运输方式，都是卡牌。玩家需要打出一切对应的卡牌才能进行某项行动——比如如果要从A地发兵抵达B地，玩家需要握有A地的地点卡、AB之间的交通方式卡、以及军队卡，才能进军——相当于一个官员只有拿到一切相关的行政文档才能下令。而玩家每控制一个新的地点，都要抽取该地点的对应牌，游戏越深入手牌越多越难以管理。;可以看出密教模拟器几乎是Wallace这三部曲的Tableau Building版；其流亡者DLC更是跟Wallace另一部作品[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/141517/study-emerald]A Study in Emerald[/url]高度相似（有趣的是，A Study in Emerald也是一个克苏鲁主题桌游——其改编自尼尔盖曼的《绿字研究》）。用密教模拟器制作一个Wallace游戏的mod也不成问题，机制几乎完全通用。;无论是效仿还是英雄所见略同，AK和Wallace都是抓住了「卡牌管理」的「官僚」一面，并将其转为与叙事相符（玩家担任一位「管理者」）的gameplay。;;3. 本游戏证明了一种「桌游电子化」或者「桌游机制表现形式」的可行性。;逛创意工坊的玩家可能会注意到本游戏最受欢迎的mod之一是一个明日方舟mod。该mod至今仍是demo版（作者因为游戏不再支持相机自动移动一类问题而停止了更新）却拥有极高的关注度——一定程度上是因为密教模拟器的桌游机制表现明日方舟的故事或游戏体验都很「合适」。[strike]邪教头领每天派出教徒下地牢摸金掏宝，罗德岛博士每个月派出干员当打手维持治安[/strike];「游戏机制」某种意义上来说也是游戏主题的「表现形式」，我们评估一个游戏的gameplay时，也会或多或少关注其机制能否适用于游戏本身想表达的东西。;AK在很早以前（2016年？）的一篇开发者日志中说过，密教模拟器将是他对互动叙事游戏机制的一次实验。（AK本人正是开发互动叙事RPG出身。）他的实验很成功：密教模拟器证明了「一张桌子上一万张卡片」也能讲述一个庞大的世界观，同时也没有特别落下gameplay。;而「一张桌子上一万张卡片讲述庞大世界观」是源自桌游机制的。AK本人也从不讳言这游戏有多像是电子卡牌构筑混合电子TRPG；他最近甚至出版了一套同世界观下的TRPG规则书。从Martin Wallace的诸多桌游中，我们也可以看到这个机制/系统的巨大可能性——不仅能适用于互动叙事、资源管理，也能驱动政治、军队和大战略的模拟。;最近发售的[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1948280/Stacklands/]Stacklands[/url]即是一个把类似「一切要素都是卡牌」和「桌面卡牌管理」或机制应用到电子游戏的案例，而且是大成功案例。不过相比密教模拟器和Wallace三部曲，Stacklands更接近其老祖宗Dominion（比如这游戏抽卡是...买卡包，gameplay也更简单直接），并且在短时间内产生了大量的仿制品和山寨版。;希望以后能看到更多开发者像AK或者Stacklands开发组一样，意识到桌游和电子游戏之间的互动可能性。",

    "review": "A really cautious recommend. The game introduces experimenting with different cards and different places, and pulls you quite well into the character you're playing. Where it gets a little frustrating is in the interface - place a tile or card in the 'wrong' place on the table and you may have to figure out why the screen's locked up and you can't interact with anything, cards will bounce around the table and you find yourself having to pause just to track down the one you need which may be hiding underneath and so on. It feels cluttery without a way to guide cards to go to certain set places after use or on discovery.;;I'm probably going to be playing more, it's really intrigued me - the writing style I enjoy as I do the fragmented nature of the story telling, but I can certainly already see some of the criticisms about grind within it to creating cards to the timers and having to slot them in the right place at the right moment.",

    "review": "[h1]不再冰冷的洛式世界[/h1]    ;    传统神话的一大特征便是以人塑神，希腊子夺父权，北欧兄弟相争，日本兄妹相恋，华夏上尊下卑。神话由人书写，自然也被人赋予了种种含义。;    克苏鲁“神话”却不具备这一特征，洛老跳脱出自身人类的局限，为我们描绘了一个更加残酷、冰冷、绝望的宇宙。这里的神祇可以看做是宇宙法则的代表，很难以人类狭隘的情感去定义。;    [b]如果把传统神话与克苏鲁神话相结合，会得到怎样有趣的故事？[/b];    密教模拟器由此开创了独属于自己的神话风格，司辰有些代表宇宙法则，还有些则是凡人飞升成神。相较于克苏鲁神话中难以理解的诸位古神，司辰的行为已有逻辑可寻（这方面与传统神话相统一）。;    无形之术的学徒通过典籍记载的只言片语构建司辰们的故事，残片断章中描绘着漫宿残暴、狂野的历史。禁断的文字背后隐藏着对未知的恐惧，司辰的动机也许可以解释，然而祂们的力量与行为方式，已经远非人类可以理解之物了。;    漫宿因此而栩栩如生，权力、爱情、妒忌、争斗，此地不再冰冷；漫宿也因此而恐怖诡秘，献祭爱人、阉割以敬神、剥皮以成神、洞开己身而飞升，此处容不得仁慈。;;[h1]加上些许人间烟火[/h1];    加班当社畜、熬夜研读典籍，同时还要夜行漫宿，不能忘了公众场合语及怪力乱神，当然还得时刻关注探险队进展[spoiler]（ 看看是不是又该掏钱了）[/spoiler]，也别把警探晾一边[spoiler] （ 否则啥时候给你送进去的都不知道）[/spoiler]。就这多线程操作，称教主一个时间管理大师绝对不过分（[spoiler] 也难怪浓情蜜意的时节教主没伴侣反而觉得安逸[strike] 吾辈楷模 [/strike][/spoiler]）。;    此番种种，描绘了一个挣扎求生于1920年代的雄心勃勃的教主。青年、警探、医生、富家子弟，机缘巧合下获悉了禁忌的诱惑，决心脱离凡庸的束缚。这故事常见于俗套的修仙小说，然而得益于本作优秀的叙事功底与氛围渲染，飞升之路同样对屏幕前的玩家充满诱惑。;    与此同时，本作设置了大量的世俗结局——警探晋升高位、职员担任经理、舞者接受求婚、流亡者销声匿迹。不论结局难易，每一个都精心编写了文案，言语间毫不吝啬赞美之词，对玩家在世俗中取得的成就给出了肯定（一般的克系游戏是不屑于俗世功业的）。;    [strike] 恋爱模拟器 [/strike]，“我听过一个故事：天平一端为一颗心脏，另一端为一片羽毛。”羽毛昭示飞升，心脏则代表爱情，在大功业成功的前夕，你是否愿意放弃飞升，与爱人共度余生？如果你的答案是“我愿意”，那么恭喜你，你将收获20多段不同的恋爱经历，或炽烈，或忠贞，或奇妙，或平淡。但始终不变的，是教主与信徒共同研习无形之术后，那洗尽铅华的美好。;;[h1]辅以出色的玩法[/h1];    本作几乎将玩法做到了极致，健康、理智、激情的三维升级，步步攀升的职工之路，巧妙地将夜行漫宿与寻宝机制结合，密传与影响的合并与拗转，仪式的方式与所需物品的结合。许多的机制与技巧隐藏的极为巧妙，随着游玩时间的增加，你不禁会惊呼：“原来还能这样！”;    奖励机制以外，还有诸多限制如影随形。猎人紧追不舍地搜集证据，恐惧、入迷的强烈压迫，每声钟响连带的生存压力，伴随着异质的渴求撩拨着心弦。精心设计的阻碍与背景相结合，飞升之路的每一步都遍布艰辛。;;[h1]点睛之笔是本土化翻译[/h1];    部分神祇的名讳：The meniscate，The door in the eye, The madrugad;    祂们统称为：Hours;    神祇的居屋：Mansus;    如何信达雅地翻译以上词汇？;    且看翻译组是如何做到的：;    部分神祇的名讳：弧月，瞳中之扉, 昕旦;    祂们统称为：司辰;    神祇的居屋：漫宿;    “夜不能寐，侧耳倾听。微风穿梭于枝桠间，窃窃私语。房屋沉溺于自己的梦中，大声呼号。这皆是混沌所经之路。”;    “当我们注视火焰时，我们所视何物？我们找到此物时，它会说出：一个赋予转变神性的词汇，此改变随烧焦的皮肤剥落而出现。”;    这只是一些例子，你很难想象这样带着疯狂的诗意会出现在一个翻译作品中，同样很难想象这些语句不用中文表达的意境。然而翻译团队做到了，做到了以文字构建如梦似幻的奇异世界。;;[h1]难道就没什么缺陷吗[/h1];    当然有，本作目前有很多小bug，这些小bug也许并不影响主要的游戏体验，但每当它发生，总归还是不太舒服的。例如，有些卡会被莫名其妙的一直被吸入正在进行的进程之中，一直持续到该进程结束为止，持续不断的噪音着实令人懊恼。;    本体玩法较为重复，本作的新鲜感主要是由文字来构建的，这也就导致如果玩家漏看了某些文案，或者干脆手快直接收取了，烦躁感与疲惫会骤然增加。再加上大部分本体职业的开局除了小部分剧情不一样，其余的流程都是相似的，时间一长，难免不想再重复这一枯燥的过程。（当然这一现象在DLC中得到了很好的改善）;;[h1]结语[/h1];    文字的魅力总是无穷的，相较于其他媒介，私以为文字是最为激发想象力的载体。这也是本作得以成功的主要原因——独特的神话体系构建出的秘氛与文字的配合天衣无缝，每句话、每个字的背后都有着引人遐想的迷思。放任想象遨游于纷乱迷幻却又真实可感的异世，探寻潜藏在世界表皮下的色彩，亦如飞蛾扑火，那光满溢而出，狂乱而又充满诱惑。;;;;;;;;[h1]后记[/h1];    感谢你能看到最后，以下是废话时间。;    本作极其适合未接触过克苏鲁文化的玩家作为入门之作，这也是以我本人的经验得出的。之前向几位老友推荐克系文学，收效甚微。毕竟克系文化以绝望为底色，洛老原作大量的形容词让人望而却步。真正出名的几部，如《墙中之鼠》、《印斯茅斯的阴霾》、《疯狂山脉》、《敦威治恐怖事件》，都有较强的叙事主线逻辑，其余的诸如《星之彩》、《暗夜呢喃》，则很难说有什么故事性，文字与描写都艰深晦涩。;    这部本来是打算抱着试试看的心态推荐了一下，当时一并推荐的还有《灵魂摆渡人》这样休闲的种田游戏，对比这样轻松愉快的作品，《密教模拟器》很难说的上是亲民，自然没报太大期望。然而结果却令人惊讶，好兄弟拿着我的账号一连一个多星期，每天从下午到晚上都在研习无形之术，最终与我协力把时间刷到了123.7个小时。这热情着实令我欣喜，在我的刻板印象中，克系文化一直是小众爱好，也因此我开始反思本作的与众不同，思考它与原教旨克苏鲁神话的区别，评测的创作契机便由此而来。;    我本人一向是比较反感原教旨主义克苏鲁神话的。的确，洛老对于恐怖文学的贡献绝对是开拓性的，但这并不代表后人对于克苏鲁神话体系的补充和完善就是错误的。也许克苏鲁神话也因此被加入了很多被视为幼稚的元素——旧日支配者有了阵营与元素、相生相克，但也正是这些工作，才使得这样一个亚文化得以走向大众的视野，剔除恐惧，放大神秘，克苏鲁文化得以成功影响21世纪的大量恢弘的叙事作品。（最近比较火的网文《诡秘之主》也正是如此，虽然我不爱看网文，但这部的名声还是有所耳闻）",

See there's two ways you can play Cultist Simulator really, you can choose weakness and go to a wiki or something and look up all the information for what does what, you can go to guides to learn strategies to win the game. Alternatively, and I highly suggest this route myself, you can play it how I think its meant to be played, forget all about wikis and guides, pretend this is the mid 90s and you'd be lucky if anyone on a forum even talked about your favourite game. Buy a corkboard and a bunch of red string and thumbtacks, start taking notes as you go. Realise you may have screwed up royally and keep notes of your 'poor life choices' and find out that it wasn't poor life choices, just a different stepping stone on the path to an over-all eldritch greatness...or death, death is always an option. If you'd rather chicken out of all that though I suppose you could settle into a desk job for the rest of your mortal life too. ;;I suppose if you make it through to the other side, I might see you there.

I started to enjoy the fact I encountered new tasks I could do, new cards would appear, new results would happen! Did I know what was going on.... mostly.... but when a bit would fall in place and I understood more, the grin on my face was constant. ;This is a game of discovery and I honestly could not be more pleased with it. ;A deep game, with a fascinating story line that is hidden beneath a layer of logical puzzle solving... and time is running out!",

The gameplay allows you to go at exactly your preferred pace. It's shocking how urgent a game can feel when I spend so much of it paused. This pacing draws me in, invites me to flow.;;It is suggested that you explore and take risks, which will certainly be necessary as the game does not hold your hand or tell you what to do. Nonetheless, if you are resourceful, you will rarely get stuck.;;Every piece is important, but I must give some special attention to the writing. It's so beautiful, poignant, and evocative. It sparks my imagination and makes me long to return to a world that never was. The writing is a rainy, lamp-lit night in the city. It's a suspicious glance from a stranger waiting outside a door. It's grasping at the dimly recalled scraps of your dream, and feeling that some deep significance is slipping through your fingers. If only you could remember.;;This game makes me want to believe in the occult. I've searched for some of the people/media referenced in the game, hoping some of it is real. Perhaps some things are better left imagined.",

    "review": "Very interesting concept that's great at making the game slow. This is very good at the start because everything is so confusing. It makes playing the game more than once (or even just mid/late-game) pretty unpleasant for me. ;;I'm still willing to suggest it, because it was a really engaging game, and well worth the money since I got about 25 hours out of it before everything made enough sense that it was boring to have to wait for my decisions and actions to process. Basically, once you have a plan and understand what your goals are the limitations become much more apparent and time-consuming, and in my opinion not worth it. ;;The game is about experimentation, and once that's gone so is the game. A very cool concept, though, and one that I hope to see explored more. Also, the fact that you can't box-select in this game when a vast majority of it is laying out the shitloads of cards you end up with seems... less than ideal. I want to stress that I really enjoyed the mechanics, but they only work well in the context of someone learning to play the game.;;All in all, worth the money, but not a game I would play more than once or twice. If you're looking at this game and you enjoy choice-based games or choose your own adventure books, then you're on the right track. Otherwise I would proceed with caution.",

    "review": "It's a great game, though I have some reservations about it.;;THE CASE FOR:;;- Novel approach to gameplay.  Very engaging.;- Unique, captivating setting -- especially The Exile.  The world of Cultist Simulator is sinister, complex, and uncanny, and a ton of fun to read about and piece together.;- Aesthetic, writing, and soundtrack all complement each other very skillfully.;- High degree of challenge ensures that victories are hard-earned and rewarding.  Figuring out the right approach to a problem is a lot of fun.;;THE CASE AGAINST:;;- The core gameplay is based on timers counting down.  Not bad in and of itself, except that it can hook the player's mind to an inconvenient degree, the same way that idle incrementers do.  It's a game that's hard to pull yourself away from, sure, but for the wrong reasons.;- The game's opening screen and manual both encourage experimentation, but I find that to be difficult given the amount of things that are going on simultaneously.  When the game has around 6+ countdown timers for different tasks of varying complexity running simultaneously, it's exceedingly difficult to focus on one particular endeavor long enough to learn organically how to do it successfully.  Simultaneously learning how to manage the character's mental health, public suspicion, expeditions, cult, secret knowledge, Mansus excursions, and so on is practically impossible without a guide.;- Upon which note, it winds up being one of those games that benefits to an almost comical degree from having the wiki open.  There are way too many moving parts for this game for wiki abuse to not be a thing.  We're talking about a game in which victory requires you to collect and use several dozen different \"book\" items, all with impossible-to-remember names, about a fifth of which unleash potentially deadly mental conditions on your character when you use them.  We're talking about a game in which victory requires you to send expeditions to dozens of vaults, each of which requires a different combination of follower skills to complete successfully, and sending the wrong followers gets them all permanently injured or killed.  We're talking about a game in which most of your midgame and endgame progression depends on the Mansus, each visit to which has you open one of three doors to receive one item from each door's loot table of three to six items -- oh, and there are fifteen different doors and you'll never remember which door to try to open to get what you want at any given time, unless you have a wiki tab open.  It's a problem.;;All in all, though, I like the game, and I'm interested to see what's next for this franchise.  I did beat New Game+; without getting too far into my strategy, I'll say that my MVP was a nameless \"Experienced Swindler\" hireling that I picked up within the first few minutes and made heavy use of until the very moment of my victory.  I didn't even end up sacrificing him to the Spider Door when I was in a jam near the end; I didn't have the heart to after how much he helped me over the course of the game.  Thanks and good luck in your future swindling endeavors, buddy.",

Well, perhaps you read for a degree so useless even the morgue wouldn't hire you.  Or you had every comfort you could imagine, and then the dreams began.  Or you, ahem, borrowed seventy-seven years of some poor sod's life and didn't think the rest through.  Regardless, welcome to the Mansus, glory is up, worms are down, and either you suck up to the Platonic ideals with attitude that own the place or you find your own way to go toe-to-toe with them.  Don't like those options?  Tough, you'll like being a raving lunatic or serving a life sentence for crimes you're not allowed to know exist less.  You can always be deader, after all.;;So those are the choices: better enjoy the long climb up.  And once you've gotten your bearings, there's a real pleasure to laying all your cards out, sitting back while your long-suffering minions bust open yet another ancient tomb or summon a living firestorm to incinerate the reluctant plod who just wanted to go back to reading his paper in peace, and using forbidden rituals to transform your body into something very much not quite human.  And oh, you will learn, you will learn to see patterns in the mad kaleidoscope of books and letters and tantras.  Perhaps you'll even come to understand, if dimly, some pretty deuced important things, like why daybreak is wan and the sunset bleeds in the evenings; whether Vienna still exists; and how the end of everything will begin.  (Not with a deicide, but with a pilgrimage.);;But not the true mysteries.  Where, exactly, your spurned lover buried her eye.  Who Janus is, or was, or will be.  And why your beloved cat is aligned with the devouring lusts of the Red Grail.  I followed mine around and pestered it for an answer-- in vain.  But perhaps you will find out.  Rise higher, see further.  The dreams are imaginary, but the delight is real.  Into the fire you fly.",

Fortunately the cards do add a bit of a theme with images and text. The game is aesthetic pleasing but a bit limited.;;Your goal is to try and get more cards by mixing and matching other cards. The gameplay is mildly addicting and exploring what cards do can be interesting. The downside is that a lot of the time your cards are taken away from you during specific events. This therefore reverts your progress and feels like you're losing your time. It could be part of the challenge to keep up with every little detail but I found it annoying after a while.;;This is a difficult game and it's not too obvious what to do next. Also, what is adding to the confusion, is that when creating cards you can get different RNG results.;;I did not finish it but I played for a few hours and got what I wanted out of it.

The initial curiousity of the first two hours makes way to confusion, which in it's own term gets replaced with annoyance and irritation afterwards. ;;To put it simply, the game didn't made me feel like a cultist. You're playing as a deranged man who struggles to navigate his life between crippling depression and insanity, all while trying to stop your funds from dwindling so that you didn't suffer a death from hunger or deteriorating health. You wouldn't even be thinking about occult things for the first several hours because you'll be busy stabilizing your existence. And once you do reach the occult you'll find that it's just a glorified Mahjong. ;;The gameplay isn't automated in any way and is incredibly repetitive.

    "review": "Imagine this scenario.  You're cleaning out your grandparents garage when a dust old box falls on your head.  You peek inside and you find something that looks like a board game or ouiji board or magic / chemistry set, you're not sure because instead of English or Greek or Chinese, the game and rules appear to be written in a sparse script that looks unlike anything you've ever seen.  You spend a few hours trying to make sense of it and put it away.  ;;But somethings is lingering in the back of your mind about that game.  Was it... alchemical?  occult?  You come back to the box, and spend a few more hours.  The game comes with a deck of cards and tiles, and it seems to be responding to your moves, even though you don't know what you're doing.  Suddenly a week later, you realize you've played with your occult sorcery set every single night this week.  What's more, you somehow understand it, even though you don't want to bother trying to put the complex system of magic and logic into words.;;That's basically the type of transformative experience of trying to win this game without looking up the rules.  Every time you play you'll figure out something new.  The game will TRAIN you to play it, if you allow it to.;;The complexity of the game is disguised by the inherently intuitive mechanics.  The  actual lore and narrative... well I feel like I'm just starting to get past the first phase of rules and the narrative there is great, but I don't honestly know how deep or complex it gets yet.  But the part that keeps me coming back is that feeling I described, of deciphering an occult artifact that unlocks new connections on the board and in your mind in concert.",

    "review": "Literally one of my favorite games. I own this game on the PC, my phone and a tablet, with the tablet being my favorite interface.  I've probably dumped 300-400 hrs total in to this game, and have (across all accounts) gotten most of the endings.  ;;Weather Factory has managed to take a simple, time-based resource game and turn it in to a dark, resource organizing puzzle.  The sound is brilliant, giving a tactile feel to most actions, ambient music that is relaxing and driving at the same time, and that frames the decisions that you make quite nicely.  The dream-break noise, in particular, is a fantastic flourish.;;The UI, while not perfect, is perfectly functional.  I rarely run in to major problems, with the sole frustration I have being that occasionally the game will unorganize your cards on rebooting, and lump them in the center of the table, resulting in a frustrating few minutes moving things about.  I have noticed several complaints about the new UI, but perhaps it has been patched, because I haven't had any issues as of yet.. It's definitely not unplayable as some are claiming.;;I would say the real drive here, and the reason I likely enjoy it so much, is the lack of information provided to the player, and the blind fumbling that necessarily ensues on your first few playthroughs.  The game seems to provide you with juuust enough information to keep you interested in finding out more, and rewards (and punishes) experimentation.  With enough time, most of these systems start to make sense, and you can plan elaborately and far ahead of what is going on in the game.;;The last thing I love about this game is its fun permutation on rogue-likes.  Some choices and results of some runs carry through to the next... and getting some of the best ends requires sacrifice and repetition.  Major endings can take a long, long time to complete, and it can feel great to knock one of them off the list of to-dos.  ;;Final words on this fantastic game : It's a beautiful, time-oriented resource manager with stellar audio choices, difficult to parse choices, and it requires experimental learning to master.  Do yourself a favor, and buy this game.  And when you do, try to avoid looking information up.  The beauty of this game is the blind choices, and the learning from run to run how the game works.  Read carefully, check aspects & know that it might take a while to figure some stuff out.",

I enjoy learning how to beat hard games but after 4 tries I can't make it to the midgame even with the help of the wiki. The low RNG chance to foiling hunters means my cultists get whittled down too quickly. Replenishing them requires the Talk verb, which is needed also to heal them or level them up or to send them to try to foil the hunters. Basically, progress is stymied by an over-congested Talk verb. If the game had more options for dealing with Hunters then it would be playable.",

Sure its a marmite game but thats whats great of such things; love it, hate it - you still have an opinion and a feel for it.  How many games or books or other things do that?",

YOU have to figure out how the game works, YOU have to figure out what the clues in the lore you find means. YOU have to decide how the game ends.;;That might be a turn off for you, and that's ok. This game is also quite clearly a refined proof of concept (it also doesn't help that it's Weather Factory's first game). There are some janky mechanics and a reliance on RNG in some places of the game, although coming from an XCOM enthusiast perspective, this doesn't bother me.

    "review": "I love this game. I wish it loved me back. ;;So much of my time spent in this game is spent wishing there were actually decent usability features. The point, at least on the first playthrough, is to figure out how the cards interact with each other to tell a compelling narrative, but about halfway through that playthrough, you start playing \"Organize Your Cards\" simulator. It's atrocious; group moving is inconsistent at best, the raw quantity of cards makes organization near impossible, the separation and constant fading of certain kinds of status effects like reputation and mental ailments makes organization a never-ending battle, and most importantly, under certain extremely common conditions like \"there are too many timers on the board,\" the game slows to an absolutely unplayable crawl, where even fast-forwarded time ends up slower than real-life time. If this game had a sort function, or even passable optimization, or like... any sort of opinion on how you should be organizing your board, I'd enjoy it a lot more than I do. ;;God, please let me just hit sort. Please let things with different timers stack. Please stop making me hit \"pause\" every 2 seconds so I can figure out where my cards got scattered to. ;;Or don't, I've already lost like 2 days, so...;;Update: Played through to one of the major endings. Towards the end of the game, I spent about 5 hours doing about as many expeditions because the raw number of cards on the screen made the framerate and timer tick-rate slow to an abysmal 5 frames per second, causing in-game time to be even slower than real-world time, even on fast-forward. The game became borderline unplayable, and it speaks to the quality of the worldbuilding and writing that I wanted to keep going despite the absolute hell that was the actual experience of playing it. Honestly, even if that were not the case, the game became the least interesting grind of \"hope RNGesus finally lets you win.\";;At this point, my recommended way to experience this game is to play through to a standard ending once to get the experience of discovery, then read a wiki somewhere to actually get to read the excellent writing.",

    "review": "I have 250 hours in this game.  I have gotten every major victory other than the Exile DLC.  I very much like this game.;;However, as it is right now I cannot recommend it.;;Currently, the UI is a mess because of changes that were forced out before they were ready.  It has been like this for a long time and the developers have not learned form their mistakes.  I understand that game development is hard.  I sure as hell couldn't do it.  But what I do know, and what I do practice in my own work, is knowing when you've created a bigger problem than the one yo are trying to solve.  The UI before worked 99%% of the time.  It was within completely admirable tolerances.  Maybe there were underlying issues that the developers wanted to iron out, but if there is a problem the user never perceives then is it really a problem?;;Even then, it is possible to play this under the classic branch and have the same UI as before.  But I still have to call foul, because the developer response to backlash has been awful.  If someone complains that your game is needlessly broken, it is not OK to ban them.  It is not a breach of rules to be angry about a product you purchased being torn apart in some ind of insane vanity project.  The attitude of the head developer has been terrible, and has severely tarnished my views of Weather Factory and their products as a result.;;None of this had to happen.  But they decided it should happen, and that it should continue to happen, and as long as it continues like this I have to give one of my favorite games a negative rating.",

    "review": "Many games have great lore, few games do a good job at making the lore matter in any meaningful way when it comes to playing the game itself. The Elder Scrolls might have a fascinating history, with multiple clashing perspectives that may or may not be all facets of a single truth, but none of that actually matters to the vast majority of people fucking around in Skyrim. Not really. And knowing it is certainly not a prerequisite to, you know, playing the game.;;Some people will claim that Cultist Simulator doesn't provide any direction. They are incorrect. It's just not in the places you expect, and has a generous dose of in-universe obfuscation lathered on top.;;Cultist Simulator, more so than any other game I've played yet, requires study of the in-game lore to get the most out of. Not just reading, but genuine, honest to god study. You have to be willing to re-read things that you think you already know, not just because the game involves a decent amount of grind if you're lost, but because the meaning of a sentence can change dramatically depending on what you, the player, know about this world. There are passages of text in this game that provide shockingly straightforward advice for attaining your ascension (carry the marks of your desire to ascend to the Stag Door) the problem is that the in-universe authors assume you already know what they're talking about. You don't and sometimes you stumble onto solutions. Other times, you need to figure it out the hard way.;;Oh, and just like real-life occultists, sometimes they just lie to you and expect you to figure out what's a lie and what's the truth. Or sometimes they're just wrong. It's up to you to figure that out.;;The key to enjoying this game is to accept that you're going to have to stop and think long and hard about lots of Proper Nouns and obscure symbolism and whether or not you're missing a piece of the puzzle or are just failing to recognise a clue. This is not a game for everyone, and that's okay. No game is.;;However, if you're interested like me in the bizarre and frustrating world of occult research, where half the shit is made up and the other half is written by someone who actively wanted to stop the \"uninitiated\" from understanding what was going on, but this time with rituals that actually work... there's nothing else like Cultist Simulator.",

    "review": "Gonna note this first; There are some decent sized bugs at the moment but they're working hard to fix them. ;;The game at it's core, when there isn't bugs it is fun and intriguing. I love card games and this is no exception. I still recommend it for a few factors;;1. The dedication of the devs.. From what I know the main devs. are 2 people (husband and wife), there could be more people on the team but I'm not sure. The fact they put this much effort into it is amazing with such a small dev. team and the amount of content there is.;;2. The game is fun and the bugs are easy to work around. Save & quit, then reload and 9/10 times it fixes it in my experience.;;3. The amount of content is great, the RNG stories are fun to fallow and the whole thing is kind of a puzzle game at the same time.;;Only gripe I have with it besides the bugs is; ;1. The docks for the cards and action blocks. Not the biggest fan of them and I feel like it clutters the board a bit. I would like a choice to remove them, have only one of them, change the size and to lock them as it's easy to click on them instead of the card.;;2. The difficulty is pretty high. I could be bad at it (I think I might be) but it would be nice to have a difficulty slider. I think it did at one point but I can't seem to find it. Maybe I'm not looking hard enough or it's just not there.;;Besides gripes I still like the game and think this team should be supported. I like their idea and can't wait to see what their book of hours is like as well.",

In essence, you play an individual in a vaguely Victorian setting who learns there are hidden mysteries that underpin our world. By finding the right artifacts and lore, and attracting the right followers, you can unlock the secrets of these mysteries and gain the attention of godlike beings called the Hours. Play your cards right (see what I did there?), and you can pass through the otherworldly Mansus and receive your final reward.;;To accomplish this, you play cards (wait, I should have put this first for the pun to make sense. DAMMIT.). I don't want to say too much about the mechanics, because the core gameplay loop is figuring *out* the mechanics. You have to experiment with card placements, \"Verbs\" (action slots such as Study, Dream, or Work), ingredients, and other elements to see what effects you can conjure.;;It seems simple at first, but it's deep and compelling gameplay. I love this game and you should buy it.;;Pros:;• the game is the rules, making for a unique experience;• intriguing setting that hints at a larger world/mythos;• shades of cosmic horror in a totally different direction than Cthulhu;• lots of endings make for significant replayability;;Cons:;• will consume your life;• punishing save mechanism (or lack thereof) means you fail a lot;• can feel a bit grindy in the mid-game;",

    "review": "When I first picked up this game I was beginning a phase of the Lovecraftian horror kind and seeing that the game matched my interests, thought I'd give it a try. I could not have stumbled into a better masterpiece of literature, aesthetic, and game design than this. That being said if you're not interested in horrors beyond the comprehension of mere mortals, (aka if you don't already like lovecraftian story elements) this might not be the game for you. If you do however feel ready to bask in the all the glory and horror you can bite off and chew, I could not recommend this game enough. The thing that makes it amazing is how the writing builds on the world of the game in a way that makes you want to understand more. The mechanics are simple in theory, but the farther you go and the better you get the more it feels like you're actually there, herding the powers of gods, gracefully standing on the edge of the knife. This game is a masterpiece for the lore lovers, the deep divers, and the atmosphere drinkers.  Don't let any other reviews convince you otherwise, this game is amazing and deserves your attention. ;;Let the games begin, and may the odds be ever in your favor.",

    "review": "Perhaps one of the best choice I've made on Steam.;;The game is fun and aesthetically pleasing. I enjoyed reading the lore, discovering my way forwards and being constantly challenged as I go further in the game. The learning curve is a bit steep and defeats later in the game tend to be very frustrating (after all, watching all you've built up crumble in 60 seconds is very unpleasant). ;There is a lot of thing to explore in the game, with a wide varieties of legacy to start from, so there is always something interesting to dive into. I recommend playing it blind, but there's no shame in looking up what to do next and what's the victory conditions are. Additionally, I also recommend setting aside some time to sit down and play the game, as a victory isn't something you can finish in just 1-2 hrs. Once you've made it past the harsh learning hurdle at the beginning, you'll begin to see and appreciate what the game has to offer.",
